3051,D9BC7F4F22F0,"Well what i think about praising for a student is that it could be achievement or self-esteem. Praising could be good/bad the way how you used it. People who is a praising could be good/bad people who helps other people just like a hero, it also mean a ruler too. People who used praising could used it as a expression. Some people used praising as self-esteem to get there anger out on someone,and some peolple used it as a achievement. Some people used praising as self-esteem to ignore their pain or just get ther anger out.

some people that are using praising as a achievement is good person why becasue you can do lots of things that make other people think you are a hero or a leader. It could used it in school,wrok or in general outside the word. theres lot praising in the world. Theres fighter fighter who help people with a burning house, and theres a cop who find bad guys who deserve to go to jail like crimital or robbers. And now theres us we can help people by asking if they need help if they are strugging to carry something or they have a flat tire you can help them. Just overall help people that are struggling because peope will follow your step by seeing you do it. If you see a old lady go help her bring the stuff to her car or ask her do you need any help if she say yes then help her and if she say no then shes fine but atleast you ask because some people are watching who is helping or not.

Our world need more better people by help other people, we dont need any drama or bad stuff happen to our world like that. We need our world to be friendly so other people can visit us more. How you can make this world better is by help other peolpe that are struggling, care for each other, be friendly to other people make friends, and lastly be positive to other people who you see. The truth about praising is that it deopend on other people sees it and used it outside the world. If you used Praising for bad thats on you but if you used praising for good then yay for you your making this world a better place and envirment for other people and changing others people mind about our word we live in. Some people used praising for good and some people dont and thats okay,why beacuse people sees praising diffrently from what we see in person, and thats fine thats normal for people that dont think the same as we do.

3117,DC7961960711,"Activities that are being done in school will health benefit for most students. School activities will bring enjoyment for some students, and they would see there friends which makes them happy.

I agree that the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families because of students needing more time on homework and studying, students wanting more time on other hobby's, and students would like to choose the right activities for them.

Students would like to have there own time to finish homework and studying. Some students would like to be involved in extracurricular activities which makes some of them having a hard time in school or having good grades, because they don't have the time for studying and completing homework, and also it makes them stressful because they might be having hard time to understand the teacher in the classroom.

Students would like to have more time on other hobby's that they enjoy to having. Having extracurricular activities after school or before school will be affecting the student in some ways like students won't be having much time to hang out with friends or playing video games, and also it would make the students really tired for school or free time.

students choosing what activity they want will be easy for them. Students would probably choose the activities that there good at or if they want to try it, and it helps them trying out new activity because it will be health benefit for them and they get to meet new people.

Some might say that the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families, because they will need more time on homework and studying;however, being involved in extracurricular activities can help with scholarships.",2.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.5,0

Be sure that you're working in the right path all by your self, and be greatfull, powerfull, be honest, not making any bad disesion not making any problem for society, and last but not least, have a strong felling of wanting to have something or wishing for something to happen.

If you have strong belife in god or in the doctrines of a rilegon, you'll be successfull in your life because it's him that give you all those idea and knowledge, that you can write an essay something like this.

So you just have to be faithfull, and trust him, that's the only way that he can help you and then be an accomplishment.

Something that has been successfully, it's beacuse of you pushed your self you put all effrot and work on you, and that's all beacuse of one goal and that is a great accomplishment.

We have to follow those poeple who were successed in their life of time, we have to see what they did to their society, what honor they had/have for us to read and follow the path they followed.

I think that's another way to be successed.

I'm compeletly agree with this statement that says ''To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.''

If they want to do that the rule said is they decition,or they opioniom because they are freedom right, but i am disagree with thus rule for one reason, that it's. That if they don't want to failure you have to fight for yours dreams for everythink that you can do it, and say thank u god for give me that opportunity and say i am so pround of me.

you never give up just kept going and follow your dreams to have a good future and don't be failure and don't play with that things beacuse you can practice once and you can take that thing for a while of your life.

I will give you one example for this thing, you see the poor people that they follow the rules just for money or do whetever things just for money is because they just wanna a good future for they kid's and they don't wanna failure they just fight for they kid's to have a good education and they hope that one they they can be somebody profetional like doctor and help them family to get out the situation of poor.

I hope that everyone in this world can see the right things and complete and don't be afraid if you don't do nothing bad why you suppost to be afraid you have your right laws. If you play wiht that thing you can fail in your life, but you can learn that way because when you broken down and you say i can't continue with this, is when you have to say i am stronger, the life give a leason, and i learn about that. Now i see and i can be better.

You can see now that you can do it. When you wish something like be profetional, soccer player, but if you play with failure you can fail thats right you can not have to play wiht that.

Also there is going to be peoples in your way that they dosen't want that you can be happy, like a fake friends, and sometimes we were really surprised because someones in your family are fake too, but don't pay atention to them just focus in your dreams and finish.

Another example is my self because when i came in United States, i don't even know English and i thoght that will be more difficul for me, i thoght that i will fail every class, but is not how was i thihk because i just focus in my class and i work hard every single day, and i never fail one class that's right you never have to loss the enthusiasm in your life and enjoy every single day, because the life is just one and we has to make the most of opportunitys in this life, and be happy every single day.

When i came in United States without my parents i thoght that will be more difficul for me, at the beginnig was so hard because i always live with them but i never give up because i know that they want a good future for me and i saw that way and now i juts want to help them because they are a good example in my life they say to me, son just fight for your dreams and don't worry about us you know that will be ok and that's right i never loss my enthusiasm because i want to reversed the help that they give me one day.

My father and my mother say, you arer the reason for work and fight so hard for you. You will have a good future don't be afriad don't loss your enthusiasm. That's right i never loss my enthusiasm because i take the example that they give me because i wanna be a good example for my childrens and be like my parents or better.

When you have a problems to solve and you feel that you can fail just think creatively about different ways to solve and actively work to balance your mind, health and emotions or enthusiasm. we have to develop many ways to solve the problems.

secondly why i think you should get you advice form other is that you get to pick out if the situation you are is bad for yuo or no like for exmaple if you are in a risk taken situation that you think you should do and you ask your mom if you should take the risk your mom might say no just to keep you safe but if you ask someone else that is a risk taker they might tell you to take a chane go thourght with it.

2294,AB75D2DC92B7,"Schools were made for people who wants to learn and be a successful person in life even though , there are some people who don't have the opportunity to be in school. Right now in some countries be on school until you are 18 is a law but it other countries government those not care about children future. Here in the United States they have the option for students to attend classes from home by online or video conferencing. They have that option specially on universities because some universities are out of the city and a percentage of students with a bad economy may not be viable to get transportation everyday. So In my opinion that is a great idea to have that option on universities. They should have the same option in high school but not to all the students because that may cause students to fail the classes. High school 's should give that option to students with excellent notes and for students who live out of town. Attend classes from home by online or videos has benefits, oneis you become more responsible,

second it helps you to earned money, and gives you more opportunities to success.

In one hand,Attend classes from home it may be a big responsibility because you are doing it by your own no one is going to help you or push you to learn. For example when you attend to class in a school or colleague there is always a teacher ,who is there to help you,supports you ,and make sure you don't fail your semester, they also make sure that you are learning and getting better everyday. Instead when you have to attend classes by yourself you must be confident and responsible to make sure that you are going to take classes everyday and don't waste the opportunity,because no one is going to be telling you more than 3threet times to do you work .There are some students that don't know what be a responsible person means, does students may not be viable to get good greats by taking classes from home. This kind of students need help from someone to push them and teach them to be a responsible person. Be a responsible person is important because it helps you to success in life gives more opportunities and you don't depend from nobody you learn how to do things by your own.

In the other hand one more benefit to attend classes by home in online it helps you to earn money specially if you live in large distance from school. A few houses are located miles away from the city that means schools are located miles a way from home. In that case attend classes from school it would be very helpful and a big opportunity. Because take transportation everyday Monday to Friday it may be expense because you may pay at mornings to get to school and pay back in the afternoon to go back home. One more benefit is that it help you to success,you may be a viable to find a job. For example you can do your online classes in the mornings and find a part-time in the afternoon. Many students do this they go to school on mornings and work for a couples of hours at night. But if you could attend classes from home it would be so much easier to work and study at the same time you would made your own schedule withou a problem. Also make sure to give enough of time to do your online classes and get good greats.

In conclusion

I do believe this potion to attend classes from home in online or videos is a great opportunity. Specially for students who live out of the city and for everyone who was to success in life no matter what. School and universities should let students know about this option. I am agree and I believe that I may not be the only one who support this idea. Therefore this opportunity should give to students who really needs it and no to those who would waste it .This kind of option should be in all over the world to help people with bad economy and help those who want to success and have a passion to learn.

I believe that each person has 2 face`s 1 is used in the work or in the school,and the other face is showing on specific moments in your life as stress or your soccer team is losing 5-2.

one example of that is: when you are so angry an involuntary you use bad word, and after that you feel very well with yourself.

It alright to teach sign laungue to students because one day they met someone who know only sign laungue so he/she can commutity to the person.

There are some school that are teaching students sign laungue to commutity in the real world. Sign laungue is still use til this day around the globe. Why sign laungue was made for? There not manys people can hear or talk so he/she use sign laungue to commitity to others to people around.

Even though things are different in sign laungue and talking to commutity. You remember even words to commutity to person or people and in sign laungue you'll remember every hands sign to commutity to the person or people. It choice for your own if you want to learn something new in sign laungue.

First, the students has more distraction in home; with vedeo play, and othe oction, more students work a time with taking a class, more with have a classes in distance, the schools need a tanking a other options. With lern in school the students are more specific learn, with a have a teacher opposite the student to learnig more specific, when she tanking the classes to has a more effective for a students.

Second, I hink this option for learning offer the class in distance wich a attend classes from home; not is a good option for example: in my house a have three brothers, and one sister, I think is distraction wich learning in home.

In finally; with reason with not is good idea the learning a distance the school, I think is more elementary, basic to taking the video conferencing online, because; learning more in the watch the vedeo conference, with online; is more effective memorize with the morning in not in evening, the students have forceful in the morning, but no think this is a good option for a students, not have a good benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

1756,85004BC426B1,"Would you like to seek multiple opinion from different people? I think is good for you to seek opinion from people . Seeking multiple opinion can benefit you make new friends,

have good relationship with your friends and make someone trust in you to tell their secret to you. Well that is what i think about Seeking multiple opinion.

Seeking multiple opinion can make someone trust in you. When someone trust in you, he or she can tell you their secret about everything they have in secret. If someone trust in you he or she will know that you are a good friend. For example,

if you do something wrong to your friend who trust in you, She or her is going to forgive you when you say sorry because, he or she trust in you. Being nice and respectful for example, not saying bad word to someone to be depressed, saying please when you are asking someone for something can also make someone trust in you.

Seeking multiple opinion can make you have good relationship with someone.

Having a good relationship with someone is a good thing to do in life.

Having a good relationship with someone can make him or her get close to you . Helping your friend for example, helping him or her with his homework or something he or she needs help with , advising him or her to do the right if he or her did something wrong, being nice and respectful to everyone can also make someone have a good relationship with you.

Seeking multiple opinion allow you to make new friends. Sometime when you are making new friends you dont just have to make friends, you have to think about it .

Make a friend who respect everyone, correct you when you do something wrong and someone who is there for you because, when something happen to and you have a bad friend, he or she will not help you but, If you have a good friend, he or she will help you when you are in a bad situation. Good friends are all way there for you when you have a problem with something or someone.

Well that is what I think about seeking multiple opinion. I hope you know some benefit of seeking multiple opinion . Whould you like to seek multiple opinion from different people ? I also hope you learn smoething from what I think about seeking multiple opinion.

Influence sometime is when you have friends,the friends say do this not happen or make bad decision like rob,kinll other people. The friends you want or interest is because is the ""THE MOST POPULAR"" in the school or where you live. If you don't want this in you life you ask why are do this?,this I want in my life?.You need thing very caution for not make things in one day;Some people are in the jail beacuse they are do thebfriends said and now this people are in the jail.

I think the influencing use for many reason in this life,you can use for:make a money,friend,do good thing not bad things with other people do. The friend never are you friend beacuse if you have god said don't doing this beacuse you problem with the police,in the school or maybe with you parent's. When somepeople said this is not you friends is because there are not you correct friends ,the friends are doing god think for with have problem or go to the jail. When you need something the real friends are for you.

The influecing is the what in you life you want influce other people with god things for this people do the same you donig with the same people. The best way to influence is donig god things other people beliefe in you,never thing if I donig bad things I'm the influence,I'm the most popular in the school or village. Only you do if doing bad things is go to the jail or make many poblem with the people are closed with you,you need make are god decision in you life because if you don't donig has so many problem in you life.

Influence is not better with other people,you influence is whre you donig with you friends or new people you nevre see,if you want god person you need or change you influence because if you donig bad things the person never want you friends because they not want problem or go the jail for make a rob there not want.

Some peope beliefe thay you do bad decision or make something very bad you not are god person. Other people said if you belief in this is beacsue you never thing you can do god person in the life.

You don't change if you not want but rember if you want the other people beliefe in you and with you influence you need change you influnce.

The influencing is the best or the influence is the better is the same for me because if you tryng do god person and change you influnce you can do.

The bes influence is make god things for other people need help or do something specializ for you friebd or family.

The better influencing is you change becuaes some people said or you familiy same need you change you influence beacuses the influence one day you used for you dream job or when you go many office for job,some offrice said you have god influence with other people work idifferent country.

If you not have or has problem you never have god influence in job.

You need god influence in the futere maybe you used for make money or relationship with others people are in you social class.

Also,you need god influence in this life,you never thing when you used the influce,donig good thing but never take bad decision in the life.

And the end;If you have god influence with other people never take or make bad thing that you go to the jaiil. ",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.3,0

431,20A42E81AC2B,""" How village people get education ""

A village have a school and they are diside learning the people, they offer for distance learning. They do meeting for that and everybody agree for that. After few week start the class. Some students visit every where and they try to teach to viliage peoples and attend to them. They think village peoples learning everything . What they are need?

I think""yes"" students would benefit from being able to atted classes from home.

My first reason is some village have or had no one go to school. They just doing hard work. One day some peoples visit this village and they deside. They will be teach to them. Then, they are start the classes . Some people think it's crazy. When everybody learning they know it's good for everybody. They takeing online or video class for how they are makeing graden? how they are growing up? how they can't do hard work? First issue is how they thing about that?

My second reason is I think the peoples they don't doing any study they will be face the any problems. This why they need to study. some people thing study is bad thing of life. How we solve this problem? The people teach to them many things for examples:

1. Girls under 18 they don't get the married.

2. how control the birth?

3. They are need a nice future.

4. Boys and Girls need the education.

My third reason is I resoonse for the reasons because whole world peoples need the good educaton or genertion of future. Because who didn't get study they no how can talk to peoples. I agree for that because peoples need the educatoin. The village people now go to school and they send to child in school. They students help to them everything what they need to every daily life.

My conculation is one second, one minute, one day, one months,and one year peoples need the study or education. Because people don't get study the will be get poor. I'm agree with this school they deside good idea for the village peoples. The learning is don't finish because will leaning every day some thing new. Study can't be finished when you will be die. Also, they need to do how the students teach to them and how they are learning.

Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for education purpose. Many people say cellphones is a great tool for specific things, such as something you may want to know or something you do not know. In my opinion cell phones should not be allow to used it the classroom because students use cellphones all day and do no pay attention, cellphones it can be used for other things, and cellphones distract you.

The students use the cellphones all day and do not pay any attention during class is really bad for students because, they come to school to learn and not be in their cellphones. For example, cellphones it may help you to look for something you might want to know, but when the test and quizzes comes students are not going to know anything because students did not pay attention for being in their cellphones the hall day doing nothing.

Cellphone it can be used for other things, for text with friends or, play games during classes, for watch videos during class, listen to music and not listening on what the teacher is saying. Also students use cellphones to take videos, or photos that they want to search in their social media or just for have fun. For example some students likes to take photos of someone just for have fun or just for bully them in their social media.

Some people say cellphones is a tool to do homework, project, or something you want to do in your cellphone, or when you are confused with something, however cellphones distract you to do those kind of stuff, such as being at your apps and not doing what you suppose to be doing while because you are texting or face timing someone and you get distract and you forgot about to finish your homework or classwork that the teacher have signed you to do,and your grades might go down into a zero if your keep distracting yourself being in you phone during class time.

In conclusion some schools use cell phones in their classroom for educational purpose. Cellphones should not be allow during classroom for educational purposes because students would not learn anything if they are in theirs cellphones during classroom , we know that every student love being in their cellphone during the day, but cellphones will not help student in their educational purposes, and cellphones are not gonna help you learn what you need to learn during students school education.

Students try to get more energy to do that. They are eat breakfast in the morning. They bring some snack to their house. They believe that students must be self-confident in order to learn.

Students work all the time to get the best work. They study after school at home. They do their homework and they practice some exercise when they have some break or when they complete their all work. Some students go to the library and get some books to read about the class, they need to pass.

To be sure that they can have evething they want for life because soometimes people try get somenthing but they can't. It's better to force their self to get whta they really want.

1759,856351253492,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" Will if you try will you be able to grow more? Does it matter what you eat? What can you do about you height? I disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson because i dont think that you can make yourself taller. He say if you try will it even work? I still think if you try it wont work because the height we have now is because our father in heaven made how we are now.

First, it doesn't matter if you try or not your height and how you look it comes from your parents genes, and it can also come from another family member. I don't think that you can do anything about your height because it depends on your family too. Even if you try you all you can do is to try to have a nice body, but about you height i don't think you could get taller then you already are. The only thing that can change is your body what i mean is if you chubby, over weight you can do excuse so you can have your body the you once wanted to have. If you really skinny you can eat a little bet more, but if you like how your are now you dont have to change anything. But like i always say ""Love yourself and how you look no matter what people say, the only one who could change you is yourself.""

Second, I don't think you can make yourself taller because there is no way that you can become taller then you already are , and don't you think that the really short people will be taller by now then shorter.

I think that they would not like to be short because in this world there is really mean people that will laugh about others, or how they look, and how short they are. So that is why I think that there is no way to make yourself taller.

Don't you think that short people will be short, and be laugh at no they would not like that son that is why i disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson.

In the other hand, it does matter to eat healthy so you can be in shape and you will be in this life longer. Normally you can do anything about your height because trust me if you could i've been taller by now. I don't like to be short because sometimes i get judged by my height, or how i look, and how chubby i am and i would like to have everything perfect like all those ladies and girls in the magazines or in the TV shows, and i would like to be 6 .3 ft tall then 5.3 ft. So yeah they is no way to change how you look , but by fixing yourself like: Appalachians, surge, and other things you understand what i mean right.

So that means that i still disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson because there is no way that people can make them self taller because even short people or person will be the size or shape they will like to be. This world is not that perfect because if it was everything or everyone will be how they world want to be in this world. So that is why i disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson as you can see i give reasons and examples.

This goes to the person that ready's my story please give me a changes to pass just one i have never pass an SOL before and i will be really happy if you could pass me just once in my life. On this one i have tried my really best so you could understand me what am talking about.

I think Thomas Jefferson quote he wrote ""Determine never to be idle it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"" is right. I think that we accomplish more if we getting the work done faster working hard, and getting more people to always to work on it.

Getting the work done faster can help. if we are working all day faster and faster we might get tired but people could get more stuff done. If we are building a house and we work on it everyday but some people are just working slow as they can it can take them a year and two but if they were going to work and working faster and faster they could get more done and even get more house to work on. Some people might say that even if I'm working hard I still fail or just done accomplish of what I'm trying to get but if that happens to me I would work harder and faster so I don't fail and and I would accomplish what I'm trying to get.

If you are working hard and always working you are going to get what your trying to accomplish. Working hard mean actually doesn't mean you have to wake up in the morning a go work all you have to do is when you go to work work hard and work all your effort. Some people say that I don't have to work hard to get what I want well in my point is if its a long time goal why not make it short term goal and work hard and hard. If its a short term goal finish it in a day if you believe yourself.

Sometimes working alone can get boring and upsetting. I like to work with people that are happy and believe in there self, and they can get somewhere in there life. People like to work there friends that can distract them from what they are doing and they won't be able to focus on what they are doing. Even getting people to work can make everything easy and get the work done and get what you want to accomplish faster.

Conclusion I think that getting the work done faster and working hard can mange what you do and can get more work and you can get what u want get what u accomplish by working hard and faster.

think is better to work in group because has a lot of benefits. One of the example is the group help to think better,

each other and fast. second the workes is help to earn more money for the company and for the workes.

The first reason the workes is help to find information and internet or and books when some one had a problem like some one in the group is sick the other ones substitute in a job, sometimes in a group has a lot inconvenient like someone disagreement but then can fix an any problem to solve because they are professional.

The second reason is to earn money and hours,

when the workes work great an a job the company is pay more better , in a group is more beneficial for the company and for workers an extra hours,

because they do more efficient job, and also workes can help to earn more business with other companies and other countries more practical to work in a group they can help each other.

In conclusion I think is more beneficial to work in a group for several reason one of then is more easy to think in group help each other when the work is difficulty. Other reason is more practical to work and earn money for company and for workers and its beneficial to work with other companies.

3417,EAB299C6ECED,"First Impressions are almost impossible to change this is true but they can also slightly change a little bit over time. I personally agree that is almost impossible to change an impression about someone so lets say that I agree and disagree because the statement is right but not everyone is the same, your thoughts and the way you think are different from everyone else, so the way you feel about a person could change over time. The first impression of a person about you could change over time just like your first impression about someone you've never met before could change as time passes and yall get know each other and hang out, go out to eat just like in a relationship, when the girl meets the guy and he looks so handsome, respectful, polite, nice, generous, very responsible from her point of view, when his at school, work, even when his home or even to the point of calling him sexy even if he is the skinniest guy ever you would tell him ""Wow baby, you're so sexy"", even if his not you would say it because you wouldn't want him to feel bad or anything to ruin that bond but when you guys start talking even more, start to hangout more often that bond will start to grow stronger in confidence and trust so when that time hits, It gives us a whole 360 degree spin now you start to be more open with your partner and you actually start saying the real things, Im not saying you have to lie but people in specific try to cover their lies with other lies and some times it dont even work or it don't add up at all but what Im saying is that when that right time actually hits you start being more open and you're not afraid and for the same the reason, you guys develop your ways up and work it out to the point of building a really strong trust, that confidence in you guy's eyes, that key to your heart and let everything be free.

It will take a while for you to see the prove but probably not to long but the results will come at one point and don't doubt it. however, with your first impressions you will represent yourself to the people or the way you act or the way you act in the beginning it will make them know if your child dish, immature, or the opposite.

If you put that respect and honesty in the beginning people will treat you with respect but if you like to mess with people yell at them without respect don't expect something else because it will come back to you and there's this verse in the Bible that I like that says "" what you plant, thats what will grow"" I don't think i wordily got it right how i said so what its meaning is if you're a lair don't be mad or don't ask God why is he doing this to you because that's what you planted in the beginning. When you meet a person what are the first impressions you get of that person on how they look, act and talk. When I first came in Generic_Name class and actually met her, my first impression was she's very nice, knows how to properly talk to students and as time pass I got my points proved right.

the people they communicative using technology and other tasks, the technology is not good and bad because have different emotions in the human like when you play a video game you can find a people playing and you can talk with their but you can find varies type of people example. a good people you play and said hey add me friends but their have another people insult you, like in the social media instagram, Facebook, and other.

The technology today has to perform creating news sites for the people can buy a books, or in amazon you can buy food using you phone, and the videos there some many company in the world working in news videos games.

in the social media people used for communicative with the family and friends like instagram and Facebook this is the most popular social media in the world because you can contact with the other and find new peoples.

But the question is the technology had positive or negative effects on the people, well this is different because the technology is not bad example, the social media you can find everything there videos photos but who public this videos and photo the people this is the problem the community insinuated the technology is bad but no it's because all from the human the human create the technology for what? the human used the technology to fight and create guns, airplanes, and boats. so the technology in not bad we can use the technology for a good thinks this is my example the technology bring a good thinks and sometimes negative thinks depend how you used.

I believe, when most of the people don't understand how relevant is to do something instead of being inactivity that also serve purpose because like everybody else it is normal to always do or make good things for someone, and it could be family or close friends for example.

My reason is if we try to done good stuff for people, and not receiving anything back for example: If I give people chance to not try anything, then how are we gonna communicate? how are we going to accomplish our goal when you don't deserve it? so my point and my reason is the we need to do something about not being inactivity with people are around you. I understand that not everyone are gonna have the same thoughts as me or with other person. However we need to be on the side to the change for good.

I grew up knowing when people put a lot of their afford to you, it means a lot because you'll never know when people will trust you and believe in you again it's a huge difference between those, and we people show us or make us see how important is when almost everything is easy when we ask for it example: Trying to hard to show how many things you have done for that person without asking, but it means a lot to you because you give a lot to that person and you hope that person can give you the same thing you've done for her or him.

Sometimes some people misunderstood about always doing something for her or him like you don't have to do it for them, but believe you'll feel great if someone do something for you isn't a bad thing then you will be fine and grateful knowing that theres good people around you, and ready for help you. You ain't alone anymore believe theres people for you and try to not think too much about it.

My conclusion is about to always do something for people because there is people who will need you, and being around, and everything you want to do for them it will make it better like. Thomas Jefferson wanted to do good stuff as a president caring about his people, and making him one of the best presidents, so it is wonderful to done much for them than yourself.

. I am aggre not be a idle because we need support, we need to help which others like some poeple do that we support and purpose to help. It wonderful how much we done if we never give up and to be prepared we nerve don't know what is going to happen? in seconds, minutes, hours, you feel wonderful went you are doing soemthing to me a able to help people how do you know to look wonderful thwe things we are doing never stop continue ding the great and wonderful this your doing to succeed is doing something really diffucult and you can do this you can never give up you can continue doing this hards difficult you are a person can do things really hard you need to purpose to do this never give up.

I am desaggre in other part because some people don't want to continue and this doing this you are not able to stop for a little problem and not continue sometimes we need to choose the responsabllities we have.

For example you have a problems or difficult things you need to tried to continue to be a responsable person don't give up you porpose continue doing the great things organized your ideas and plans you have to finish the difficult things Thomas Jefferson wants to continue do we need to accomplish more if we are always doing something never stop and not doing something people said i dont know how can do this you need to some part of you to do this you need to support other persons to start doing things ,like you needed went you start doing something .

First, I thing that be yourself is something can you do in person because if you don't do that so you cannot be good person in your life. However, you most have nice personality and good respect to someone be yourself and if someone don't have affect so that person is not have good personality.

Another reason. We can do the people don't do like have good and respect to someone you have to be most confidential in yourself because you most be great person to another people in the community that mean you can have make sure people is good with that to be yourself.

Next. People can do anything to constantly to another people so that's why we need to have most confidential to make sure we need to be kind because that we need yourself to be cleanly and most respectfull and generous be to good person in the future.

Finally. Be yourself is something that's why people in the community don't respect because if yourself have to be accomplishment that's mean the you have something error. So, we need to have most confidential and generous in yourself because you have be sure the yourself nobody to compare to someone else so because you are not good person.

If your school extend school day for two hours there are some thing you can't do. You can't play after school games. You can't do your homework. You have less time to work. You going home late. You can't fresh your mind.

Reason one, students who work after school they have moer time on work. For example, if your working time is four o'clock to ten o'clock. If you work regular time you going to make more money. Students need to work becaus they needs to pay the cell phome bills or on gasolin.

Reason two, students who want to play after school game they can play the game. If they don't have time to play after school game they can't fresh there mind. For example, students who live one or two hours away for school they have time to play after school game.

Reason three, students can fresh there mind. Students can't fresh there mind because they are studying more then they need. For example, some time students can't remember what they learn in class, but can do other thinks. Some time student haveing so much fun in the class. Because there mind is so much fresh.

That why school can't extend the school day for two hours. Students can get tired in ten hours of study. Students can't fresh there mind. They can't play after school game.

I am tired to use all this drogas, i want to be something else in my life. Since this moment he chenged his life. Now he wanna be a doctor for to help people to become a some else in their life. I am agree with Emerson's statement about individuality because i can demostrate that they said is wrong, to show them what is defference between to make and to talk, and to be concetrate. Those thing i can show the people that i can doing with myself and that make me a greatest accomplishment.

I feel to be myself, it is not depend what people said about me. If i want to change or to be something else in a world, i have to do what my mind say to me, for example if i wanna be a teacher. And they tell me to be a teacher is not important because their payment is trash, they just can earn $1000 each months. But if i like to be teacher do not matter what i earn. They will trying to make me confuse. Maybe they already tried it, but they could not do it , that is why they believe that i could not do it either but not all time is the same, the world change every day so i need to try to show them that what they said it, it was wrong. So it is important do not pay attention people who try to make me confuse.

Also there are two defference between to make and to talk because i can believe in myself but if i just talk and to say i will do this, i will do that and i will not doing nothing. That way i can help the world even i lie myself. But if i did not said none and to show people that i change my life with my attitude. they will come at me and ask me what happend with me? because i am changing. I will tell them that i want to be something else in a world. That will be my greatest accomplishment.

Even if i believe in myself i need to be concentrate because i am human and i am not perfect, i can fail with my decision if i am not concetrate. Because bad people will like to see me on ground they will tell something fun that i missing. For example to study, many people do not like to study because they say that school is boring so that i am doing they believe that is boring. They will try to convence me doing wrong things so i have to demostrate them that i wanna be something else in a world not just have fun.

In conclusion, work individuality is not easy i have

To showto the people that sometime we do not need help from somebody else. Just believe in myself, do not heard what they said about me, to show them what is the defference between to make then to talk and all time to be concentration in what i am doing.

965,49D2A80F1484,"In my opinion disagree. Because some people said that is hard, take a lot of time. For example you gotta know how works all the processing, and people do not understand, so some time is very confuse. So in my opinion that first impressions, are very wrong because no everyone wants to be like different.

Secondly is very impossible to change because people do not have time to take care about that stuff. Also because they work they have boobies, shores, take care of their family so is very difficult to be part of that. But also people said that first impression is bad because is impossible to make right.

In addition, some people said that take a while to get used it because you need to be sure, to your goal come true. Also you have to work very hard, and if you do not have enough, time you not are able to get it so that mean, you have to work hard. Example like people said that impressions, are almost impossible to change well, for some reason it should be easy or hard we don't know.

In conclusion, I disagree because impressions, is not easy to take care too, many work in little of period of time so it will take me for ever to do it correct. But also people, said that is very hard and is total true so impressions are very hard to take care.     ",2.5,2.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,0

Best support for your idea is examples. I think is the only thing for support your idea.

Another one is when your parents get into a fight that makes your kids in a worry thinking that there might be a separation beetween them.5. some people are worry while taking a test worrying that they might fail the test.6. Another example is getting bad grades similar to failing.7. And more getting bullied and no one even stands up for them that's a depressed attitude and might decides to kil them self.8.

1180,5B40AA0E6C2B,"It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. I agree with this statement about the importance of attitude of the people. I think is very important to be positive and has a good attitude with everybody.

In the other head, many people likes the people that has a positive attitude. For example when I was in my country Generic_City. There is a woman call Generic_Name she have a small restaurant in the park front to her house . She was sell I say was because I don't know if she still has the restaurant. However In the restaurant she was sell many type of food. For example soup, chicken, pupusas and Generic_Name need someone to help her with the restaurant job. And there is a woman her name is Generic_Name she is very smart however she has a bad attitude with every body.

She went to apply for the restaurant job and she has a good experience in the restaurant. And there is other woman name Generic_Name she is very nice and she always try to help others in the community also she has a positive attitude with the people. Generic_Name call Generic_Name and Generic_Name Because Generic_Name want to interview. Also she want meet they and see how they are and what they know about work in a restaurant.

The fist woman the come to Generic_Name house was Generic_Name she don't say good morning she just went to Generic_Name and say I am interesting in the job.

Generic_Name was very surprising because her just ask for the job don""t in troduce herself and Generic_Name told her that she already has someone to help her in the restaurant. Generic_Name just say ok bye. After one hour Generic_Name come to Generic_Name House and she say good Morning I am Generic_Name it is here where they are hearing someone to help work in a restaurant.

Generic_Name told her yes so Generic_Name was talking with Generic_Name and Generic_Name know that Generic_Name know a little about work in a restaurant bout she notice that she is smart and with the time she well be learn fast and she well be appreciate the opportunity that Generic_Name is give to her. Also Generic_Name has a positive attitude went she was speaking with Generic_Name.

In fact I think has a positive attitude is the key to success in life. For example, few days ago my father was very worry because he has just two days to finish one of the big job the he has. He was thinking to ask my brother if he has time to came help him. My brother told him that he is going to help him and he look at my father he was very worry and he ask my father what is happen why he look worry.

my father told him that is for the job that he has he just has two days to finish and my brother always has a positive attitude and he told my father to don't worry that everything is going to be okay. And he is going to do his best to help him with the job. He is going to do the more fast that he can and he is going to ask his friends to came and help hem with his big project. After two days they finish the job on time. And My father boss was so happy that they do a great job and my father was very proud of my brother because he has a positive attitude and he believe in his self.

This is why I think that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. Because is help to win many things with the family and other persons.",2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.5,0

When older student and smaller student work together it can make friends because both student have to work together so they have to listen and talk to each other, so they can be friends. When they talk to each other they can learn more about the other person like they can know what they like or what they don't like. So they can learn a lot from each other. It mean that when you make friend it can help the smaller kids.

It can help the smaller kid because they can uderstand better about the lesson because they know then if they don't understand something someone is gonna to help them to understand. They can say their opinion because ththe older and smaller student do not have a lot of different age like could have 4 or 5 years old more then tem so that is not a lot, so it can be easyer to the small kid to explain you what their opinion is. They can also ask a question when they want because sormely they have to wait that the teacher is finish an other student to ask the question but if there are also older student which alredy do the lesso you can ask them your question. The work by different age help the small kid but it can also help the old kid.

It can help the old kid because it help them to stay calm to do not be in stress, because with small kid you have to dpeak slow and do not be angry because they do not understand you are saying. If they understand what you are saying it mean that you have to find an other way to explain it like speak cleerly with simple words because don't know all the long and difficult word. The older student have maby forget this lesson so they can relearn the less at the same time then the small kids, but it will be easyer for the older student because he will remenber quicly. So when the small and big kid work together it can creat benefits and it can help the both of the student.

So when older student work with smaller students, it can make friends, it can also help smaller student and older student. So I realy think it is importante for the small and old kid to work together, because they both have benefits to do it.                ",2.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.0,3.0,2.5,0

For example I have friends that do school at home and they are just like regular kids from High School, a lot of people would say that being home school its like going to prison but it's not, home school just gives us a better way of learning at home with no one to bother. Another benefit of being home school is that you never have to worry about school shooters bad people in school, getting abues in school, not dealing with any problems with other students. Another benefit of being home school is that you dont have to wake up early in the morning to go to school, you don't have to miss the bus anymore, don't have to worry about sports, staying after school, basically you have freedom to do more stuff, a lot of people in high school dont have time to go out or have som fun, not many kids are able to go out becasues their parents are strict and dont let them out but that's besides the point, many kids take avantange of home school some of those kids, they have parents that travel around the world and they dont have a chance to sit down and talk about what is going on in school or the everyday life, their parents will take their kids with them becasue they dont want their kids to be home alone, instead they take the kids with thme so they don't have to miis out on their aventues, and a lot of these kids are very talented and ready for the out side world becasue their education was high quiality and always on point. They are good kids and bad kids that do home school, some of them coud have got in a ot of trouble and its not able to go back to school and some kids are home school because their patrenst have to work out of the country and they can be home by their selfs and they take thier kids with the.

And they can choose good career for they life. And they can preparation they can go to wall University. When they will be adult they have experience when they get job and they get own money they will be ready but you can help you family and if you have girlfriend you can help to became they help you to when you was little boy your parents away they told you what do you need to do at you life they was good example, for you no said no because you no that

In some societies ,students can brace for the future when they want a family they are ready for change and they can get Bette life. and you can start the future they can choose some work because if you study you can get more opportunity and you can will be good person en your life a person ready for start some wort nobody said nothing because you are ready for the job and you can will be a boss in you work but, you need to study and focus in you career because you need good grade in your school you need to have good presentation and you can get good job and you can help your family and friend .

Many people can not comply they goals. because they not ready and they can not find good job because they not ready before when they had the opportunity they not appreciate the opportunity and is to late for start agent. but you can start with your life in other something like work in contrition , drive truck ,or cashier bank and whatever work do you like.

For example you can study, hard because when you will be adult your are ready for your responsibility' and you can get good job maybe in a office, the point is you can have better life and you can get, all you want in your future but,your parents can help you in this situation because they can sea go your, school study hard because when you ready you can choose your life but you can not say my parents not help me about my future.

my recommendation is you prepare and study,hard for your goals because you can get good life and you are ready for start your goals. but if you study you will be the best person in the planet you can will be good example: for you sons' and they will be very happy about they father. When they will be adult they have good example and they try to did good job for they life bacuese they have good reflection before the they was born. yourself will be the best in the planet you need to think in yourself because you need to no what will be your life and you prepare and study work hard away remember you are good person and nobody can destroy yourself                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ",2.5,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.5,0

In the positive side technology comes in handy a lot you can shop online , pay a lot of your bills online and do a whole lot. In the negative side you loose contacts with humans cause every person abuses technology , people always on their phones , people losing eye to eye conversion with each other.

technology will always have a good or bad side in way how humans use it.

In the positive way of technology , a lot people use technology to shop online , a lot of times people try to find the products that he or she wants to find in the store and its to expensive to buy in store , people find it more cheaper products online than outlet stores. Not only people shop online, people also use technology to buy programs that colleges recamend them to use. It helps a lot of people that are in college that do a lot of homework a lot teachers assign homework online than paper. technology always advance everyday in a good way to enjoy. A lot of high school students use technology to do homework for a class that the students miss that day he or she was absent.

technology keeps everyone in check and organized. But yet even if theres a lot of positive stuff about it ,

there's a lot negative things about technology.

In the negative part of technology ,

a lot people thats on their phone ignores the person that he or she was having a conversation with.

The main big problem right now is that people are abusing technology by texting and driving while using their phones , a lot of people are getting distracted on the road cause they want to answer their text message but most of the time people that answer gets into a car crash for getting distracted.

The way I see people using technology its good cause it a lot easier to organize important documents , shop online , doing homework for school and everyday technology will always advance each day.

The only problem thats bad about technology its that us humans getting distracted easily by using our phones , playing games on console , and getting distracted easily. Theres always gonna be a bad and good towards technology it all the depends how humans use it.

When the student is in home he going to do what he want he don't care the class he going to feel like if he don't have to do have to work in that class and he don't thing if he going to lost the class, one example is one of my friends he have a oline class but when he is in home he dont work because he dont care because no have one teacher who says ""Work or you no going to pass the class"" and thats one reason.

My second reason is when the student is taken online classes he just going to finish, he no going to learn because he dont care learn he just going to complete the leasons but just that, why? because he dont have the teacher who explaing when he have questions or when he is interesting in something of the class he no have the teacher who know more abaut that.

Some people says when the student take the online class from home he are more concentrade however whent the student take this classes from home he are more distractic because he have the cellphone in his hand or he have the TV in the room, the dog, the play station and he going to prefer play or see movies than work on the classes.

In conclusion thye student can no work , no have the teacher for question or warn he can lostr the class or are more distractict or prefer play than work on the class are my reasons for no take online classes but with the good students can be a good idea.",3.0,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.3,0
7,008DDDDD8E8D,"I think it's a good idea for the estudnets to commit to a career at a young age. In addiction, the students are expected to identify a career they want and use the best for them. So the students can study in higt school and select to guide them to career in specific they want.

Fisrt, In high school all the students have diffents dream on the world. Some students dream to be a Doctor, arctecture, teacher, and nurse, ect. Is a good oportunity to have a good education and a make a good person and helpfull. Then, the students can have a better life and good jobs.

Sometimes the students in young age estared to think about what carrer is better for them. Others think what career is usefull to make a good money and have a better class social. But all the students think diferent the others and we have to respet they decicion about they future.

secondly, In my opinion is is good to think or dream in biger. In my potition my family do not have all lot of money to go to the university and pay for it. For example, some of my friends are a good Doctor and arquicteture, but the thing is when they want to be a good person a get better futures on their lifes. Usually, when we think about it , but is so dificul to do it.

Thirt, students in the school have special classes to go with a career. all the people have the oportunity to think about, which want to study and where they go too. But some students cann't go to study the career they want ,because some of them have to work and pay bill in their hause. usually some of them have everything in the house and the only thing they have to do is study and make sure they work to complite all of the school and can go to study that set.

In conclution,

is a good idea to know what you want to study in young age. Also to be responsable all the things and have a great time of the life to think what is make you happy when you grew up. One day a want to be doctor of the animals. that will be make me happy.                          ",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.4,0
3612,F3B7C2480747,"Do you wonder is a great idea to choose a career at a young age?

In my position is a exellent idea to choose career at a young age, Because in some socities, student are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. their are many courses of classes are selected to guide them toward to choose a speficic carrer. for example: first it benefits them to start at the age to have in mind what are some types of career the student want for his or her future after graduated high school. Second thing it would persuade them which type of diploma they would like to have if the advances diploma or the standard diploma, the advance diploma it requires to have 9 sol pass and all the classes and for the for standard it requires 6 sol and all the clases. when you enter to high shool your counselor would guide you which diploma the student want to have and which career for the future. third when you are in high school they give the student basic classes that you need to pass for 9 grade and 10 grade to persuade faster and easier , to have some experiencies and knowleged on what are your goals and be prepared on the others two years,

if you like the same career you pick when you enter high school or you want to change your mind on a diffrent type career want to do, teachers and counselor are a great full help for student to succes to guide the student what are some great benefits the career the students pick to study to give him the amount of money to lived and work with the career and be succesful in the future when the student finished the high school. Finally for 11 grade and 12 grade they give the student some diffult classes to pass to graduated from high school , 11 grade is more diffult to pass, Beacuse it requires 2 classes to graduated pass for to get 12 grade the student only come for the classes the counselor give student to be prepared for what diploma the student choose , if his the advance diploma or standard diploma for his or her carrer the student choose to graudated.

for my conclusion is a wonderful way to start in a young age , To start thiking what would you want for your future if this is a great career to pick and whats benefits give you for your future, in high school they prepared you for what the student planing to do when he or her graduated from high school , if his going to college to have a better life or go nova to be prepared on what you like to do in the future, You hvae some knowleges of what carrer you would succes in the future and start thiking this is what you like for your carrer and make it real the dream what you want to become in the future.

there many career you can choose to become someone in life , this is way i think they should start at the young age when they enter to high school teacher and counselor would do the best to make the student to choose one career studen is interested on. to study in the future and sucess on college to have a better life for her or his family in the future, thats why is great idea to start at the age to pick the career they want to do on future.",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.4,0

One reason that I agree with this chance that this programs it is offering. because must students like me need to take the high school diploma and try go to college or try to find job. When they have the high diploma ready. Must students take time during the summer to on focus in class or during the evenings.

Because someones students work k in the morning and the rest work during the evenings. But all this students want to go to college. This should the first reason why could be a reason this program. can allow the students get the high diploma done.

Most of the students are preparing for good colleges and some of the colleges you have to stay so many years to finish them. and also from my experinse it is hard enough as it as in four years but i know so many students have done it before and they sucssed on it. and i know some student have done it too but in 2.5 years. and i almost have done it and it have been good for me but it need alot of work and you have to study hard and foucces in your school and do your homwork and get good grades and don't do any pronlems in school becasue if you did any thing wrong you are going to stay more years at the school.

it is good to graduate early whenn you are young so you will have alot of years in college to be a heigher education. at the end i would say and support every one that want to graduate early because it is good for their future and i have to say thank you for the people that they are helping me to do that.

Many people can't drive to meet up with people.

So they just stay home and call them on there phone or call family from the other side of the world to say hi by using technology. find friends to chat with. Play games with online.

Some people use technology to learn new things or maybe see what other people are dong on Facebook, and snap chat. Technology is a good thing to use when you need help trying to learn new things. Kids at school can use technology for school. Technology can be use for homework school cluds. School can make it a safe thing to use. Many teens will lear how to use technology.

Other people will tell you that technology is bad for you because your not making new friends faces to faces,or going out to place to have fun. The people who say technology is a good thing have a good point because some people are better of staying home or even doing work from home where they wont have to talk to other people.

Old people can use technology to rd books back anything they want to read. There are many books online to read about war , cars , sport and many more. Old people can learn how to use technology so when they want to call family or friends on the web they can.

Many people use technology to Oder food off line and get it dropped off at home. Technology can Chang every one life.

Many people can benefit off the web and help them with taxes and how to do it or let someone do it for you online. Many people dont know how to talk to people so hey are sacred to leave the house so they use technology to talk to other people and find things hey both like.

They can order things offline and get it the next day. If like technology can Chang everyone life and make it better.

3232,E1DB041DD77B,"The statement positive attitude is the key to success in life is true,the attitude is important in life. No one want to live their life with the negative way that not good for everyone, their family, and everyone around them. Let thinking about that when you have positive attitude and good energy and give it to everyone first thing you got is people will love you because that make people feel comfortable when near by, they feel your positive energy you giving to them,and you will have a good friendship when you give them the best feeling they need after all the problem, stress in their life. The second thing is that make yourself happy, life is tired you will not happy if always have a negative attitude in life, no one can make you happy except yourself. The last one is some people think they are having very bad life, they always get the worse thing than other people, and they want to give up but if they looking around them they are not the one have the baddest life. Follow that way you will never become success.

When you do a good thing make everyone happy and you will feel like you are so cool, you are very good, anyway you will feel happy because you was did a good thing and when they happy they will give their love, their respect. They like you and when you get in trouble they will help try their best to help you without your money like the way you make them happy. Or the long time no see they still remember you in the good memory, and not forget you make feel you important in the world everyone not forget you, that is the success in life.

I am very sure most of us learn from teachers and parents are always the positive way and positive attitude, they will not teach you some thing bad and negative, what is mean? That mean they want you to live the most happy you can because they know they can't go with you or following you forever. The success not mean you become you must be rich or must become famous, you can think it the easy way is make yourself happy. For example, when you rich but you not live positive attitude and people not respect you, love you, support you, or you always worry about your money, you get stress or some people always say they love you but for real they just love your money when become poor they will leave, I am sure you still not happy for that way.

People think they have very bad life and always think the worse thing that the negative attitude and it will go with you forever and you never have the better life, the life you want and you never become successful. Why people always say never give up or you don't know how far you can touch your dream, you think it very far away, some it next to you but you just don't take your chance and your time to finish your dream. For example you think you don't know or not good at anything, why you don't try it? whatever you are you still not doing great for the first time just do your best, you can do better for the next time, you will never know what you can until you try it, you believe you could and you did it. When you touch your dream by hard-working, and you will know the challenge in the life make you grow up.

in conclusion, the success in life is can be base on the attitude you have, the positive is always good thing for your life, that make you life is easier don't make you life become too hard. The first of all you need make yourself happy, then you can make other people happy, finally don't give up make your life going up by your hard-working if you can do all of those thing you are successful not by your career or your money but by your good energy and positive attitude make it become success.

One idea for student's is they every school realized every year differents options in menu for bote students in one sitio web and when they have a results change the menu in school is a very well benefit for students because when you eat good your brain is more concentrate in your work is have more energy, one idea is in the morning take a frut's, or cofee and then in loch eat popeyes,chipotle,tacos and others more options because students in a long time is omg again this food the point is change food in school every year differents options for eat it's good have differents menu for year eat new food.

School is need created the importants points they students need realized after school teh first is the every students is need due ten minutes the exercise then go to lonch and take foood for eat then go to your regular classes in teh 10:00am go to lonch and eat tacos,popeyes,chipotle etc. and drink a natural water they contained natural fruts then keep going with your classes is very well take differents options in the school they realized for students look for your benefit and students is more concentarte,have new energy brain always positive because the change is wounderful in your life is very well health.

i was not able to speak English, and every time i went out to play or go to school people were showing me examples of what to do or where to do same for me if i want to go play soccer or go to the play ground ill point outside the window or draw a picture of it, i tried to come up with anther way to example what i want but examples was the only think avalibel for me until i learned English.

Example is not the mine thing in influencing others; it is the only thing because,thats the only way others will figure out what you talking about examples is what everyone use to help each other to also understand each other however,others say that example is not the mine thing to influencing other because, there are many other things to influence others for example, Google translator,Google,YouTube there is a lot of other apps that help to influence others.

i agree that Example is not the mine thing in influencing others; it is the only thing because , example is used every where and most of the time even when you want to speak to someone with another language and also kids see adult people as an example too them they see what they do and copy them example is used with everything for ex, for parents if they want there kid to be good they got to be an example of them or they have to show them an example of something or someone how to be behavior is one of the most important things because it show others hot to act and it it gives other people example of how to act in a sernat place for ex,if a kid go to a library and see tow adult being loud and playing around he going to do the same because he think that they doing the right thing because they are adult and should know how to act in place like that .

wall others say that Example is not the mine thing in influencing others because there are more thing that we can influence each others with technology made a lot for us that we can help and influence each other with other ways for ex, Google translator if i go to another country i dont need to show people examples of a museum or draw i can type it and show them or say it to them and they will give me direction and students that dont speak English can use a dictionary or Google to help them understand.

Students who commit to a career at a young age always doing better things in them life, and when students get a old age he or her always know what they have to do because they trust their work when they was young.

Ex: Generic_Name said, when she was a young, she was trust her things and it was always teaching her many thing and shows her what to do and how to be, and many people was care about her, they was not doing them things without her, when they want to do their things, they was waiting her because she was help them and teaching their, and she get an achievement in her life, and reach her goal.

1966,94ACF6006DB9,"My first opinion,

would be that to be a good person,

is you have to be your self no matter what is going to happen . For example a good behavior star at home because your parents have the responsibility to educate. Also some people said the students are very bad for other students, like they are bad influence .

My second, reason would be the your own problems can affect, your career. For example your grades at school if you are a good person with other people to be a good citizen just be you because people the just talk never do something good. But sometime teen don't deserve what they have for example school, job, people the they love them.

After that well, if you work that is a good idea because you can focus, and two things but if you are weak that will be a terrible decision . So a good behavior is excellent, because you always can find friends, and maybe a girlfriend but den pent of you.

In conclusion, if you are a good behavior you will be a good person, and the future, and a good guide for you children. Also if you are a good students,you will be have credit for college but you have to be a good behavior. So the mean, that you responsibility is work very hard to complete your goals. And help other people, who need help because the would make you a good behavior.",2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.5,2.3,0
3496,EEE6067CF9B5,Some schools have programs that older kids can help younger kids. If they don't know how to somethings in school or out side of school. Or they are there just there to assist other kids that more help then other kids this can be helpful. For older kids that they might have to teach something new that they did not know or just teach something that they had some hard time in when they where leaning this in school. And can be more helpful for younger kids because they might have to work a little more harder and get more. Challenged more then they get at home or school and they get through there homework at this after. School program and then when they get back to school they have there homework done and then there homework. Might not be late or they might just be more on top of there stuff and when they get home they just can relax and play some games or just go outside. And have good jobs later in there lives and I think that more kids should have this. Chance to get this time to study and get better programs in there school. Because we have good programs and then if most of every school have likes programs they can get help by older students and younger students can help they older can help by helping the younger and the younger if they are not doing homework and if they are done with home work they can help other younger students. so they can get the help and the assisting that need or might need because if you are good with some like math but then the homework gets harder they might just need just need some more time or more time study and going over there past home work to see if he can or she can solve that problems or if they can't that why there are the older student. That can them help he or she with the home work or projects. They can help one and other to finish faster and get their projects done if they wish to or they can just work on it just by them self. and then when most of the kids are done with homework witch most won't be they might go on there computers or they can go outside and play some outside games witch so half would go out side and the other will stay to keep this program fun and not just doing homework and classwork all day long. So they can keep or gain some energy to when they are done form playing they can comeback inside with some. Energy and not being broad all the time there are there. at the after school programs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ,2.0,2.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.3,0
2267,A9A6B5A288DC,"Should some people believe in praising a student's work to build self-esteem, even if the work is not the student's best effort. They believe that students must be self-confident in order to learn. I agree with students must be self confident because its better to grow in life then stay in the same place over and over again. If a student does not believe in what he or she can do then that student will not be able to compete things in that student's life time. Also a builds a great mindset for the student to keep moving forward. Students should have self-esteem for a successful life.

If a student doesn't believe in what he or she can do then that student will not be able to compete things in that student's life time. Student that doesn't think that their capable of doing more that student will stay the same and would not be able to grow, also that student self-esteem will lower down. Another thing a student should getting moving up and high than he or she can do is there are no limits in what that person can do if the student knows that they would be able to do what they can do they can easily grow by practicing more and believing they can do it. So by not believing in what he or she can do that will affect what will happen later in life, never stop believing in what he or she can do as a student.

Building a great mindset for the student to keep moving forward. To have a good self-esteem the student will have to set up goals to show to their self that that student can do more. Another thing after writing down their goals is which one will they do first or which one is do he or she want to compete first. With all the choices to choose like for example: goals, friends or family that support, or how will is the student want to succeed, because even if they don't try as hard as they know how to it could happen to anyone in life that shouldn't make a student to stop trying it should make them feel like okay it wasn't my best my first time he or she can get the second time because a student should always chase what they are willing to have. Building a great mindset for the student to keep moving forward is good for a student to have a great self-esteem.

At this time everybody are forgeting how beutiful is lives with out technology. We can do alot of things with out it. For example: Play outside with friends, go to libraries, and stay outside with natural. Some people say the kids have to have limitation of what they doing on they computer or cells phones. On the other side people say that is good for teenager having not limitation because they can learn more. I think teenager need a limitation of what they doing in the phones. Furthermore parents should cheking what they doing in the internet.

However, some people think is good for teenager not having a limitation because they learn more for their future. On the other hand some people say that that tenenager can't complete a taskd with out having contact with other person. I thinbk having a conversition with other is good because you get to know that person and also get stronger the relationship. When you meet a strager in the internet is dangeous, not everyone is a good person. Some parents think that the kids are just playing in the internets but they do not. I think having a conversiation to you or playing games without speaking I think that have a limitation until you know well that person.

In addition, sometimes people used to buy alot of things from the internet without knowing that person, that is dangerous. People that are seeling on wedsides that always offer what the really have or maybe they just want the money. If you going to buy anything for the internet just make sure the wedside is safes. Buying staff for the internet is getting wrong because people do not want to go aout and spend time with family. Since wedsides liike Amazon, Ebay, and others came up people atart get all they need from wedside. Bad people are used this on favor to them, they are creating so many fake wedsides to racket people.

To continue with, I think a good way to get the kid out the technology is take them to have fun outside like hand out with friends, having friends in a computer like into a videogame or a social media is not healty for the kids. You have to get to know the person before play or talk to them. Sometimes people trick the kids ask them to do bad things.

That why technology shoul not be allow for kid at all or if parents decide to give a cells phone or a computer always have to be a limitation.

Technology does not aloww people to complete task with out haave a contact with others. I think this is having a negative effects on people lives, people are getting racket because they used to maney wedsides.

I think students would not benefit being able to attend classes from home because they can not be on their telephone and not due what they are spouse to due.

First, they can get distracted, In my position

I Can get distracted went I am at home doing homework i want to wache TV even some time I do not finish my homework because i get a lot distracted. I want to play whit my brothers go out side play soccer and i say just for a little I am to playing with then but a get distracted and i for got the i have to do homework or study for a test. Some time I get distracted by seeing my brother playing video even went they is a lot of noise i get distracted because i want to what is happening or what is going on. I remember one day the I have to finish a test review at home because I do not have time to do it at school I do not finish because I get distracted by brothers. They were making a lot of noise and i could no concentrate because of then. My brothers are the same way as me they can get distracted fully easy and not pay attention on what they doing maybe they star by doing they homework but they do no finish because they get distracted by the TV or the video game.

Second, they can use the telephone some time I get a lot distracted whit my telephone because I away want to be in the telephone. Went i home I just want to be in my telephone and i do not do my homework. I get fully distracted because I want to text whit my friends or playing video games in my telephone and not Du what i suppose to to do. Went I am at home I have all I want my bed my telephone the TV the I forgot the I have to how or study for a quiz or test. Only because I at home and I have all i need some time i do not want to do anything

I get distracted fully easy and more if I have my telephone in front of me because i want to leasing to music or video chat my friend and talk and pay attention on what I suppose to due. Some time my mom tell that I have to stuff in the house so I have to do it even if I am doing homework or studying I have to what she say and then a can kip doing what i was doing. If I have my telephone whit me the only thing i what to do is be in the telephone because it is a easy way to get distracted and not due what you suppose to due.

Some people my say that if students have home school it will be good because some students can get bully at school and they do not want to go back. The is say for then because some the students do not ride the bus the parent have to take then to school and the take a lot of time some time because they have to wait. Even they are going late for work and they do not have tame to take then to school. They may say the if they have school at home they do not have to do all the work by taking then to school. some time a lot of kids get bully at school and it more easy for then do do it by home because they do not have to deal with at school they do to have to be worry what would happen to then the net they or what does people are going to do whit then, But I chose to not have school at because some people can get distracted I not saying the all people have the problem I am just saying the i have the problem they my not have. But I do not like have home school because i want to see my friend graduate whit then have fun some time go to party and now more people have more experience.

In solution, people can do what is best for you if you like do school by home because you do not like people or have personal problem or have i disability that you go it no one is going to say anything.

To be yourself in this world that is changing over and over, you have to have a strong mind, a lot of people will not be agree with what you have to do in your life, But people over think everything people say, if you want to go more higher than where you are; you will have to make some decisions in your life to make those greatest accomplishment that you want to finish and get to the top.

I agree with this statement, because the time passes in your life is going with it, the more you do the more you get and that is what people don't get, if you want to make accomplishments in your life you have to worked out man, For example Lebron James how do you think he went where he is now, Making steps in his life, goals, family help, you have all of it it is right there you just have to get it.

""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else""... honestly I will not take it like is changing you, because you are the one changing your life, yes you will be seeing stuffs you will make some errors but that is how you are going to reach what you want in life. you are going easy you will get it easy and you will get it shipper too, if you work hard at the first time, at the end it will come easy and you will be thanks full.

A great accomplishment?, That can be anything, every one is a world, what I mean by that is that every mind have the power to do what it have to be done, either a teacher, family, friends, they are just telling you where is the door, your friends are not going to opened for you, not your parents or teachers, you are the one who will opened if you want to do it and get out, and get that goal or accomplishment that you have to complete.

I can be a example for this, I used to hate school a lot, i went tot his time that i didn't wanna even go there, but there was this English 10 teacher that just speaking with me one day just one day, yes I was having F at that moment, after all that thinking a lot about what she said I passed her class at the end with a B, not knowing that I was going to be able to do it, but I did it just doing what i have to do, like I said people can just tell you where is the door you have to go get it.

""to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"", yes it is; put your self together get all the help you need if they are good person they will help you, staying quit you will not get it, asking for help will not make you smaller it will make you stronger, and that is what we need be strong and get that goal or accomplishment done thanks.",2.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.2,0

most in one point is good bad in other point is not really good because when a student take the four year of high school is most be prepared, when someone took three of school is not on total prepared.

Most kids wants take three year but they don't thinking about it; they think is easily for them. Take time and thinking, most student who follow ths plan most don't take elective classes courses for the simple act that finish high school early then other students.

Kids who finish high school, in four year they're going with knowledged that they know better than other, some high school's have programs three year until two years to study, but in some high school's it is necesary make four years for wherever reasing or for that is traditional four years as well one motive is because student after graduate they will go to work they don't go to college and that's why they took three years.

For example one's of my friend's took three years and her sister took two years my friend's who took three yaars she said that her don't have the opcion to take elective classes for the simple reason that her will graduate in three years from high school. But when she took one career of college she don't what is going on, because one of her classes has nutrition wellnes and she didn't know nothing about it.

Work in group also have benefit to, is more easy and more fast because all student do one part of the work, another benefit is if a student don't undertand the work the other student can help to explain, in this form all students understand the work, the mayority of the students prefer to work in group because is more easy and sometimes a student don't work and all the rest of the group do all the work.

They can help to teach them how to walk for the preschoolers

They can teach how to welcome people

It also helps them to have a great future

The Older students can also (maybe) earn some money for being an excellent helper to the younger students. It can also be a great hobbies for the older students to teach younger students how to live their normal lives and to greet others. Another reason why the older students to help the younger students is an excellent idea is how to be respectful and trustworthy to others. There can be a chance where the older students can teach younger students how to help others as well for example

Pick up someone else stuff if it fell on the floor

Help an old person cross the road

Teach kids how to write neatly

This kind of program could help the environment so much. The students can also travel around the world to help younger students in other countries for example

United Kingdom

Norway

Sweden

Denmark

Canada

And more! Having this type of need and help could this world so much. It helps across the country, around the world, all types of students can help others younger students how to live their lives, it can help go to collage and get a job that their very great at and in their job they can learn as well, it can make them get a talent from their job so they can learn how to do stuff in their jobs and become very good at. So yes I would recommend for the older students to help younger students (even around the world) how to live their normal lives.

We do not get to choose who our family is therefore thats beyond our control. Family can influence you to either be a great person or A horrible person. For example If you grew up watching your father abuse your mother, you have a higher chance of putting your hands on females. How ever if you have kind, loving parents you have a higher chance of becoming a nice, loving person. Keep in mind we are with our family everyday so were most likely going to end up like them.

We can't choose our community either therefore its beyond our control. Personally I feel like the community we grow up in has a huge impact on our life because it determines the kind of people you grow up around. For example if you grow up in a bad neighborhood you will be around gangsters and drug dealers. As a kid you may think selling drugs is fine because you seen other older kids do it. Selling drugs is going to result in you going to jail which means your going to be around other bad people which is most likely going to have an influence on the person you become.

Others may think seeing bad should inspire you to be better but unfortunately it is not that simple. Your character is usually built over the years not over night.

The reason why I personally don't like home schooling is because if I'm at home I wouldn't get my work done. I'd be distracted by looking at my dog and looking at what my mom would be doing. Another reason why I would not like it is because I'm not getting the same kind of education like most of the other students. I wouldn't have the chance to learn with my classmates or go on trips to historical monuments and historical musuems with them. When you're home schooled you're mostly self-taught.

One other reason why I wouldn't reccommend home schooling is because you're not interacting with other students which can cause depression and anxiety. Another reason why home schooling is not such a great idea is because when he learns how to write and read and play a musical instrument and masters soccer, running, or other sports in general how will this particular student learn how to communicate to the real world if the parent has kind of isolated him from meeting people. One of the other reasons why home schooling is bad is because the fact that parents may lose patience when they are trying to educate their children. Some parent may be too overbearing or impatient, which may cause the child to react in a negative manner.

I think home schooling is a bad idea is because he wouldn't get the proper education like most students in school. That could possibly effect the student and also that student is not interacting with other students which could lead to depression and axiety.

In order to think about something about that person you have to get to know them because if you don't know them you won't know why are they being like that. You can't just think something wrong just cause of how they dress. If you get to know that person you will know what they been through. Sometimes people judge just to judge or to think someting that is not true about them. For example when I first saw my guy friend I thought he was wierd, but when I started to talk to him he was totally diffrent from the guy i thought he would be, he is fun to talk with and hang out with.

i will like to star in saying that i think it would be good for us student to help the environment because that way there is not to much contamination on the community and it would be healthy and safe to the people that lives in the community. Us student can also do good thinks when we are doing the community service because that way un winter we can go and shovel some snow and on summer we could do other things. and doing community service its not only going outside or doing hard work you can also help some church , hospitals ,in a store and also in helping teachers and other things like babysitting. Doing community service it could also be fun it doesn't have to always be boring it could be fun because if they send you to places that you have to be with a lot of people you could be with your friend when you are doing community service like helping a teacher the teacher might need to helpers so you can ask your friend if he/she wants to go with you so you could not be by your self. community service it is also good because the way you are not always in your house trying to figure out what are you going to do because your bored or you will not be just laying down in the bed or in the sofa playing video games or watching a movie because over time that will get boring for you and it will affect your healthy so that's why its good to do community service even ones a week or in a month its not bad to do community service I do community service all Sundays and sometimes over the weekend it is so fun to do community service because i spend some times with my friends with out going to the mall or anything like that so it will be good for other student to do some community services so they can see that it is not boring to do them. so i will like to tell you principal that you should put students to do community services so they could see how good and fun it is . i will like to say that is fun to do because sometimes you are like what should i do today or what i am going to do tomorrow and you get so stress that you don't even know what to do so sometimes when you are like that and you have to do community service it would not be that hard for you to stress. you can also help your mom doing something it would be good for her to you be helping here to your dad to because sometimes your dad its tired of working and he will ask your help so you could help him and that will also can be community service because your helping your parents so that's why i thing you should put student to do the community service.

You could be wrong on some of the things that you may seee because it maight not be how and what we see,and you could have miss. In 10th grade I miss judged one of my friend because I thought he wasn't the person I wanna talk to. Even tho I had some classes with him I would not talk or be around him, because my impression was that he does not shows respect not only to other students but teachers too , therefor I won't talk to him so he would never know me and won't be mean to me.

However, Later I realize that he was one of my best friend and the nicest person I had ever met, who I can trust and hang out with. Even tho, you may think that you can not change your first impression if you think about it, it might change your first impression.       ",2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.5,2.0,2.6,1

The technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. People can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to another person. Has the limitation of human contact due to use of the technology had positive or negative effects on peoples lives. in my opinion there are more negative than positive effects about technology

One of a negative effect is. Play games without speaking. We should meet the person first than start to play with that person. instead of play via any web with someone that we do not know who is.

There is another negative effects, kids, and teenagers are able to be in contact with bad people. like kidnappers, this are bad people who take advantages of the technology attacking the most vulnerable in technology the kids make the kids feel confident, and feel they are their friend. there are pedophiles too, looking for kid and teenagers.

Also, because of the technology many frauds are occurring every day hackers stolen some of our personal information. Like our names, address, social security number, banks accounts information, and make frauds to companies.

In conclusion, I believe that the technology has many negatives effects in our social lives

It is bad for our kids, and our information in risk, I wish we could find a safety way to use it.  ",3.0,2.0,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.7,1

Because they have to get required classes, then go to summer school, and get a good grad. and work very hard after school. When those student who want to graduate from high school in three years. they must work hard for their school. and they have to pass a lot of test and SOL. To graduate from high school. then they can go to college.

example;people who are's emigrant,and want to do the three years of high school;they have to work hard.

When student want to do the offer programs three year of high school. i believe they have to work hard. To pass their classes. Also getting good grad for their classes, i believe that they must study hard, and be properer for any test that is coming on. They must pass their classes by receiving good grad. Also to receive a good GPA for their record, Students must attend every day because if they do not do that, it will effect their grad. Then they get behind. from a lot of things.

example, student have to work hard in their classes to receive a better grad.

Student who is taking summer school, and work really hard to graduate from high school. I believe they will have a better future for their life, and their family.

Because student will have the capability in the future to find a good job that they wanted. Also those student will have the capability to go to good college to study will. I believe having a good back round from high school any college will accept those student; Also a good GPA, and those student who want to do three years of high school. Must attend every day to do not get behind from their classes, Because not being at school will effect their grad. Also student must work hard for their graduation.

example, student must go to summer school, and pass those classes that they need;also i believe summer school will very easy.

They offer programs of three years, I believe student must pass their SOL in three years of high school to graduate. student must focus on their school and classes for receiving a better grad. Also i believe there are some student who have to work full time. Also come to school full time, and they are in the three years of high school program. i believe it will be hard for those student who go to school and work after school. there will short time for those student, to study for their lesson from classes. Specially for those student who is emigrant and do not know any thing about they new school. But still they have to work so hard to complete three years of high school. to graduation.

example;student will the opportunity early graduation; if they work hard.

I believe that three years of high school going to be hard for student. But it is a good opportunity for those smart student to graduate early from high school. then they can start their college earlier. because it gave them capability to make up their life Earle. Also those student will learn a lot of lesson during high school, and after high school. Then college that is the best part that student can learn the most things.

529,28639BE05BB7,"Music, drama, art class are considered as an elective class. Since such class will never be use in a daily basis in life. It's not required for you in order to graduate so to speak there is many more choices rather than music, drama, and art class to replace with it. It shouldn't be a required class for the student to take since everyone has a different mindset of what they want to be.

Something we use in our life that we learn from school is basic math to do our taxes and bills, but when will you ever use music, drama, or art in life, It's more like a hobby rather than a need in order to maintain a stable life. People don't care if you know how to write a song, act melodramatic, and how to draw Mona Lisa, applying for a job with such thing in your portfolio won't get you employed in most places. If you major in such things, only those of who are talented and skilled will only be able to have a successful life in such class. Electives are there for a reason, to have a starting point of what you want to be in the future, if it was turned to a required class, the world would have a second renaissance.

You don't need it in order to graduate. College wouldn't look into those as much as the prerequisite to your diploma or the major subject. Knowing how to paint or sculpt clay wouldn't be at the SAT that college look into if your'e eligible of going to their school or if they want you. As people grow up and go to college, their goals will change eventually. For example, you grow up and you want to be a doctor and half way through your college year you want to be a Scientist instead. You've covered some similar classes or lessons already since they are both major in science, but such classes like music, drama, or art class doesn't have any similarity when you changed your goal. They are a specific to themselves, they don't have a wide broad of category that shares with other subjects at all.

Learning and able to make music, be dramatic, and draw art might be a useful thing. Write songs for famous artist, act on plays and movies and even be recognize for your work in arts and make a lot of money from it. Only if you are successful, whether you are born with a talent or obsessed in such things and have one goal from the start. Only those of few will able to make a living out of it. It's not reliable career to as much as to be a requirement in school to be.

Only to be fixated in such subjects gives you less option of what you want to be,

it's not as needed in reality so that is why classes such as music, drama, and art be an elective. Students should not be required to take those classes since they will not have as much choice in what they want to be in their life.    ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,3.3,1
3182,DFB7AB4481AC,"I think that people can success without having the cosists of failure without loss of enthusiam. There's other way to success without failing, one of them is to practice. An another way is sometime you can get it on your first time without have to fail. Then you can just study other's failure and not make them same mistake, or sucess and try to do the same. These are other way to success without having to fail, and they are maybe more ways also. So Winston Churchill isn't wrong, there's still other success with out failure.

First you can practices, practices makes you better that thing to want to success with. It like you can't success to be the best soccer player if you don't practices. So instead of taking the test or what ever if you practices, you might not fail, you'll be ready for it or good to do it. If you want to success in a sport, you can success by practicing you can build mussel memory that can help you in many ways. If you want to success on a test you can practices on practices tests, that can help you out. That one of the ways you can success without failure.

Also you can success by getting it are on you first time, there's some time people do will on their first time without having to fail, practices, or study. They are mostly lucky when that happen, and it does happens much, but they still success. Most people like to call this, winging it, some people might success, and some might not but that a other way so still success. it might be the best way success, but might have done it and success for it.

Another way people can success, is by watching other's failure and success. When you watch other's failure you can study and try not to make the same mistake as they did. So if you saw some player or some slowed down when they were about score, but they miss or someone block them you can say, ""they shouldn't have slowed or whatever that would have help them. So when it your turn you can try to not make the same mistake and success. You don't just have to watch their fail, and can also study their success and try to do the same thing. So by watch others people success and failure, you can copy their success or improve their failure.

So Winston isn't wrong you can success form your failure. By look on your mistake and improve them and making you'll self better, at what you have trouble at. Failure without loss of enthusiasm is better then getting so mad about it and might make it easier to success next time.

So I don't agree with Churchill's statement, because their is more then just failure to success. There's so much way to success with having to fail. You can practices, study other's failure and success, and sometime success on you first time by winging it. So those are some reason, why i don't agree with Winston Churchill.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.2,1
3886,FF190BD8380B,"My grandma always said, "" Is ok to fail, the only thing that matters is to stand up and keep trying."" A decision is the act of deciding something, as a controversy or question, by reaching a conclusion or making a judgment. If people take their own decisions, they are going to benefit. People should take their own decisions because it is a right, people can learn for the consequences of their actions, and people have the ability to think by themselves.

Many argue that people should visit a guidance to take decisions because guidance may have more experiences solving problems. However, they are wrong because in the past people fight and die for rights, and now that everyone have the privilege to talk for themselves they are not going to let others to decide for them. Clearly, people do not need to visit a guidance in order to made a good decision.

Initially, citizens have the right to take their own decision. For instance, Generic_Name, who is a citizen of the United States, wants to get the divorce because he found his wife cheating on him. To specify, he went to the court to get the paperwork done for the divorce. To detail, he have the right and the privilege to get the divorce because it is human right; he do not need the help of any guidance to made this decision because is something too personal. One should observe that taking decisions is a right that everyone is able to reach.

Additionally, people can make mistakes, but they have the capacity to emend them. For example, Generic_Name, for peer pressure, take a wrong decision about using drugs. To add, she realize that what she did were a wrong decision, and she understood that is bad for her health and she staunch doing it. Clearly, society can make people do what they do not want, but is in one to say: no; and fix what they did wrong.

Last, but not less important, everyone have different ideas and points of views, and because of that people should make their own decisions. For instance, Generic_Name's parents teach him to differentiate between good and bad; that means that he is not going to be in troubles for a bad decisions. To illustrate, he do not need the help of others to make a good choice. Obviously, humans are unique and sometimes people do not going to agree with others, but that does not means that one is wrong and the other is right; people need to respect others decisions.

In summary, taking decisions is a privilege that ancestors gave us, people are going to made mistakes in order to success, and everyone is qualify to talk by themselves. These prove that citizens should not need to see a guidance in order to made decisions. People must respect others points of views and do not judge them for what they do. There is only one choice: respect and always have present that no matter what others said you can do it!",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,1
3753,F98FEC21D9EA,"Should School Extend Two More Hours To The Normal Schedule?

One topic that is frequently debated is whether school should extend the day schedule or keep a normal schedule as they have it already. Some people think that school should not expend two more hours to our normal schedule. They feel that if we spend two more hours at school, it will be boring and tired. In my opinion, school should extend two more hours to our schedule for many reasons: I can spend more time to learn in classes, spend more time with friends, and work one more day during the week.

Once, I was pretty nervous about my Earth Science SOL test, I did not know what to do to pass it because I never passed any quiz or test that we did during the school year, and I felt worried because I did not understand some topics, and I only had one week to learn everything, so I decided to stay everyday after school to practice with my teacher and by myself at home, after a couple days of practicing I realized that I had learned what I needed to learn and I felt ready to take my SOL and finally, I passed it. Now I know that spending more time in classes helps us to understand what we do not understand yet, learn more about the topics that we are practicing in class, and get ready for any test that we have during the semester.

Sadly, I am a Senior, and this is my last year in High School, and that means that maybe, I will not see some friends and teachers again, so I am trying to enjoy everyday in the school expending time with friends and teachers whether during lunch or during classes, and I think that spending at least 25 more minutes with them in every class will help us to know more about each other, and to make more experiences to remember after we graduate from High School.

As some students, I do not have a permanent job or an everyday job as some people call it, I work for a moving and storage company, and that means that I can only work Saturdays and sometimes Sundays because I come to school and they ask me to be ready in the company at 7:00 am when I am going to work, but having a free day school during the week would benefit me because I would be able to work one more day during the week, and earn extra money to buy something that I might need.

As you have read, I am agree about extend the school day two more hours. Only when we realize that spending more time at school would helps us to learn easier, make a lot of experiences with friends and teachers, and gives us a free day school to work, to do homework, to spend time with family, or do some chores at home, the world will be a better place with students that understand what they need to understand about their classes, and people who takes advantage of at least one day free per week.",4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,1

Nevertheless not everybody agree this opinion, some people disagree because sometime people with not have mastered make better the job than the people with mastered.

First, when you have a mastered your work better on this sometime to do, because this people have years to study and practice. For example in restaurant wen you have a mastered on chef you only need to memorize the recipes, other people need to memorize the condiment's, the tools, and the machines is used.

Second, with the mastered you get better opportunities, because you have a title show you already prepared for the job. For example some companies need you have a mastered for the job or the position, is like a some restaurants if you want to work like manager you need a mastered and you get more money.

Third. you get better position than the people no have the mastered, because you show your experience. For example if on restaurant need people for kitchen, manager and dish washer with mastered you get the position of manager and the people with not have mastered is more probably put in dish washer and if he want to work with manager need more time and work more hard.

In conclusion people with mastered have better opportunities, work better on the something to do and get better opportunities than the people with no have mastered. For this reason I agree the Emerson's statement about if you no have a mastered you never grow.",3.5,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.7,1
1630,7BBB35F9D1BD,"If I had to take a side I think I would disagree. One reason is that you cant always have success ,there's times where somethings don't work out. Then there's failure and thats how you have success in anything from learning from your failure But there is time where when you fail and your enthusiasm is gone because of that.

The one reason I agree is because there's time that you just cant have success. I have had that in my life in many situations. Once when I was playing soccer we had won all the games and then came to the day where we were playing for first place and we lost and that day all my enthusiasm was gone. I was so mad and just had no energy. I learned that there times that I wont win and times I will it's part of life but along the way I learn new things. Then there school there you do go from failure from failure to success because once you make a mistake and you learn from it and do better next time because your already know now but it does bring your enthusiasm down.

The next reason is that failure does does make you have success but also it make not encourage to keep going. From the first time you fail to the next will will learn something and later on when it happens again that's will you will get it. When you do fail and fail you lose enthusiasm but gain it back when you have success. You feel sad and mad and just not excited no more when you keep failing again and again. So when you fail and fail again you will away lose enthusiasm because you just can't get it.

So if I had to pick a side I would disagree because you cant just fail and fail and then have success and not lose enthusiasm. And I disagree from experience because in my life I fail and never still had enthusiasm after failing maybe some people do but I speak from my point of view.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.2,1

Some activities you can do is play sports, practice sports, run laps, and do exercise. I think that some people find outdoor activities enjoyable, because they can do activities with others and enjoy the weather while doing activities.

People should go outdoors more, because if they dont go outdoors and dont do activities, there is a chance that later on in life they can have weak bones. There are people who stay indoors just listening to music, but you can actually go outside and do activities while listening to music. If you dont like to play sports, exercise, or run laps you can just ride your bike. Riding your bike can actually help you later in life, because it can give you stronger bones and can improve your stamina and strength.

Another thing that you can do is play outdoor games, such as tag, freeze tag, and hide and go seek tag, but there is many more. These outdoor games can also improve your stamina and strength.

Technology performs multi-tasks without physical contacts with others. Due to this, people don't have to go to stores to get groceries and other materials. This is especially convenient for older ones because they are weak and stressing themselves could cause heart diseases and even death. But now they sit home and order anything, saving their health.

Secondly, technology has gone to the highest level. Today one could stay at home and socialize with friends and family without physical contact. Technology has provided social media apps making it easier to communicate without making human contact. Besides communication, people feel safer talking about their rights, the government and politics in general on social media than in public. In cases of emergency, social media has been proved to be the fastest way of saving lifes, accidents, and most importantly many deaths.

Obviously, technology has made it possible for kids who don't like school, and are poor learners at school due to the nature of the environment to learn online at home giving them another opportunity to become something great. Even though they don't make physical contact with friends, they are provided a better learning environment, less stressful activities, and the motivation to learn more and become a contribution to the society's well being which evryone today wants.

Each person want to be succesful in life, but to get what we really want, we have to be positive with the head up. We dont have to put ourselves in an unconfortable situation because it won't help us to get the succes that we want. It just going to help us to go through the way of failure. Not all the time going to be easy. We must have to fail a lot of time, it help us to see what we are doing wrong, and what we have to change to get what we want. We just have to keep going with enthusiasm and believe in ourselves. The sucess help to the people to be someone in life.

We can see in our everyday how hard is life, and how we have to strive ourselves to get the sucess, but we can see that there are obstacles and we have to know how to pass through it. Life is hard, but nothing is imposible if we have already planned what we want. Sometimes we dont get the result on what we have been worked. But nothing can be hard at all, we have to know that all is posible, we dont have to take it as imposible. One example that we can see in our everday are the students in the university. Not all of them have the support of the family to cover the cost to pay the the clas in the university. Some of them have to work to get the money and pay their study. Some of them have to fail because it's not easy to do at lot of things at the same time, but we can see that they keep going through it, doesn't matter what. To get the sucess we have to work and just focuss on what we want. At the end we can see the result. We must have to fail a lot of time, but we have to have in mind that we can do it. The people who graduate, at the end they remember how hard it was. But they believed in theirselves and also keeped their head up with enthusiasm, and learned of each mistake that they had done in the way to the sucess.

Other example can be the student from other country in high school, at the end of each year the student have to do a test of each subjet they have. But is not easy fo them because not all of them speak english, they have to learn a lot and out themselves in a hard situation to do it. They have to effort a lot themselves, some of them have to fail like three time to pass the test. But they know that nothing is imposible if they believe in themselves. They know that they have to take tests to graduate, we can see the hispanic student in Generic_School, they have to take the ESOL test each year but they have to study a lot because their first language that they know is spanish, and they just have been in this country in a little while. For some of them the situation is hard, but at the end we can see them in their way to graduate and how proud they are of themselves because it's not easy to learn english.

Also, we can see the organizations that want to help to the people who doesn't have nothing, they have to do a lot of thing and have to be prepare because no one know if they gonna get what they want. The goverment and other institutions have to aprove the organization and one of the best examples is Shakira and her fundation ''Pies Descalso"", she wants to help to the children with the eduation, and alimentation. She had to do a concert to get the money to start with her fundation, she has been in hard situation but she always believed in herself. We can see today how she had changed the life of millions of children around the world, how bennefitted with education and alimentation they are. child from poor families are now someone in life, some of them are in the university. All can be hard but never imposible. She accomplish her dream, doesn't matter what. In her way, were obstacle and difficults things. But she didn't give up because of that.

People have to know that doesn't matter what they can achive what they really want and keep going in their way to the sucess. Nothing in life going to be easy but they have to know that dreams can come true. They must have to fail a lot of time in the persuit of sucess. But they have to know that nothing going to be in the way they want but they can keep going until they can achive their purpose. Doesn't mattter how many time they have to fail, if they want to be someone in life they have to know that the way have a lot of surprices but thay have to have in their mind that nothing is imposible if they see that situation in that way. We all can be succesful in life, we just have to belive in ourselves and keep in mind that no one can make us feel less than them, we all are equal, we all have dreams and we all can achieve what they want in life to be successful.

They can now see which decision is better for them. It also depends if the advice is decent or not because if the advice is horrible, then that decision you make can affect the outcome.

Another way asking advice from multiple people can help you is they might have more experience. For instance, they need help picking a collage that suits their interest. When they ask their parents for advice, the parent might pick a different collage that could be better. But, that's because they have more experience and can see whats best for them. Grandparents especially, went through a lot when they were kids. So, if you need advice, ask adults who are more experienced in life!

Lastly, asking advice from multiple people can help you see the persons point of view. For example, they can see what other people have to say and can help you make that better decision. Let's say they need help painting their house but dont know what paint color to choose. But, when they ask someone for advice, they can see what the other person has to say and make the right decision based on that advice.

In conclusion, asking advice can help someone make a better decision because they can see the persons point of view, more experienced, and they can see which advice is better. Asking for advice is important because they can see which advice is better and can see other peoples perspective. This affects you because its on you to ask for advice and make the right decision!",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.1,1

First,Why limitation of contact to the use of technology is important and has positive efects; It seems to me that , when i used to much my phone i feel so pain in my eyes and head because i didn't had limitation of contact to the use of my phone. And phone,computers .... is part of technology to help people contact with each other and we should have limitation of contact to using these techonlogy when we need , we can use technology.

that's why limitation of humans contact to the use of technology has positive efects. For example some people destoiyerd their eyes because of using to mach technology.

1622,7B38A110CC94,"My grandmother used to say ""Your goals are not going to be done if you don't even move a finger"".

I am totally agree with what Thomas Jefferson wrote about how wonderful is how much we might done if we are always doing something. We can make plans for every goal in life, but it doesn't matter if we just have a plan because we have to work in that plan to get that goal done, we accomplish a lot things more when we are doing something, when we have that determination to get things done to feel proud of ourselves.

First of all we have to feel, we need purpose and strength to accomplish every goal in our life to feel proud in a future. For example, when I was little, my biggest dream was to be with my parents one more time as a family, we were separated at that time; I was in my home country, El Salvador and they here in the United States. I had that dream, but yes, it was just a dream. why? Because I was afraid of the journey to be with them again, they used to tell me ""If you don't do anything you will never know how different your life could be here with us, so throw that fear away and let's do something"". Then in my head I said ""if I don't get that courage to make the journey I will never going to see my parents again"" because I knew that they can't go back to my country, at the end I made that decision and I made it, I am with my parents again and as a gift I learned a new language, now I know i'll be more helpful for this country because I am bilingual now.

Furthermore, we can see in every aspect of life how persons that one day were a common citizen, now are really important in the society because they were always doing something, they were working on their goals. On the other hand we have as example my home country, El Salvador's new president,Nayib Bukele. He was just a citizen like others but he was tired, tired of the political corruption that my country was going through, so here is what he did; he made his plan, he worked on his plan, he worked and made things for the country. Then he became a mayor because people chooses him as their mayor because of all his honest job, he started running for president in 2015, he had a hard time trying to find a political party that supports him with his new ideas and purposes for the country but the parties rejected him because they said he was to young,also they knew he was honest and that he will not admit any corrupt job that affect the country, and they were always looking for reasons to reject him, but he did not give up.

Finally he made his own political party and he get the support of all the people that get tired of live in niggardliness during the governance of other parties, he fought against the two most powerful parties in our country, as a result he won the elections in 2019 and he became the new president of the nation.

Many people think that it doesn't matters if you have goals and make plans for your future if you don't have some resources as money or a good social status, they can also see life as a random game which means that if you accomplish something they will say that is just luck, however; what they call luck, other people call it, late nights of doing something for what you want for your life.

In other words if you want your life to be successful, you don't have to spend your time just dreaming about what you want, because things may be done only if you are always doing something which means; work for what you want, stop thinking about your life goals and start working on them, determine yourself never to be an idler.",4.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.5,3.4,1

The success of life to fall down is important , because with enthusiasm you can do everything, that you would like for your future, still if you fall down. Life in this world is hard to get up, but be strong person with enthusiasm, your life can be easy and not complicated. To fall down in life, you can have many negatives things in life. Life can be more hard as you think it is. Enthusiasm have many positive opportunities in life. This positive opportunities can make your life more easily, because growing with enthusiasm, your future can have more patient,less stress, and more happiness in your life. To failure without lossing enthusiasm can have the sucess of your future. Bringing success into your life, you can learn lessons, that would help you to find opportunities, for you to walk forward. In this statement I agree with mr, Winston Churchill, because this is a every important role statement, that can help people to bring the positive way for making easy life for people in this world.

To fall down in life, you can have many negatives things in life. Life can be more hard as you think. To have better opportunitites, you have to bring that energy to be strong person without giving up. If you want to have dreams, with no enthusiasm it would be hard you to get it. An example"" i want to have the goal, to have this big dream, going to collage."" If you want this dream with negatives thoughts, things without studying, and be lazy to have a job, to safe money for your collage, you can't do anything. Another example "" i want to have a car, a house, a dog, and having a trip everywhere in the world."" You can have a job, but if you are lazy to work, you can get fired, not getting that much money , that you need for all your things you want to have. To have negatives thoughts, you can't have all your things, that you would like to have for a better future into to your life.

To have enthusiasm can bring more easy and posititve thoughts, to accomplish your goals. Because with enthusiasm you can have less stress, you can have more energy, and be patient with everything. To have less stress, with positive thoughts you can make easily things, still If you think that it is hard for you. An example "" i want to pass my sol's in school."" If you want to pass the hardest test in school, to graduated you can study, paying attention to your teacher, do your homework that day is due and having your things on time. You can pass your classes and your sol's, without thinking that much stress in your mind. Another example "" i fell my exam of math class."" You can fell your exam, but you can't give up, because you can have another solution. Teachers give sometimes, opportunities to their students staying after school or come more prepare next time larning a little bit more, because it can be more easily to pass it.

To failure without lossing enthusiasm you can have the success of your future. To have the success into your possitive way, you can have less stress and you can learn the lessons finding better opportunities to move forward. An example "" I did not graduated, because i did not pass one class, it was a requirement for graduation."" It is ok If you did not pass it, but you can have a choice by finding opportunitites in others places. You can repeat school one more year, you can go to other schools that prepare you to pass your exams, and classes, you can go and find information about that class or subject. Another example "" I got fired in my favorite job, because i accidently broke a delicated plate."" You can be sad, but always go and find opportunitties in others places, that can hired you, because if you have experience ready, so it would not be hard for you where to hired you. Becareful what you do, only have the positive way and have the energy, that customers can be surprise about you, how hard you work in your job that you really like.

To fall down can bring you negatives things. Negatives thoughts can bring you in a bad ways, because you want to have that goal that you want to reach, but you can't. This can be a big situation, if you want to reach that goal, but you have to try your best on doing the oppositive way. To have a enthusiasm you can work really hard and make it more easily. Working hard be happy can bring you that attituded, that we all want to see. In this world is hard to bring people in a positive way, because life is hard , but they are people that they want to show that, you can't give up always move forward. To failure without lossing enthusiasm, you can have the success in to your future. This is a lesson that everyone have to follow and not make it hard. If you are negative, just find a way to make you think a lot, because that stress you out and have a negative thoughts, never give up just move forward.             ",4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.4,1
3133,DD00E48BC258,"Honestly, I do not agree about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. The pursuit of success in life is achieving it in many ways.. Therefore, you can push yourself to be successful by putting in effort.. Failure can lead to serious conflict because then you will not be able to succeed. The important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success is not agreeable because you can overcome obstacles, aiming the goal to success, and to achieve the plan to .success.

First reason, is to overcome the obstacles, for that you must have to work hard. Also, it takes practice the better you get to succeed. Do not give up on something you are overcoming in life. One of the biggest problems that people have in life is not overcoming what they are afraid of and from being afraid will not get you to succeed. Most of all to overcome the obstacles. is to try them not to give up on them.

Second reason, putting a great effort can lead to improving. Efficiently the work you do can increase a great impact towards your achievements. In order to achieve a method, working pays off and by earning it. For example, people push themselves to making progress. Others might work hard in different ways to be successful and to aim what they want. Eventually, when making progress towards something, can influence the goal your improving.

Third reason, to plan the success is to try achieving what your aiming for. In other words, enthusiasm can be those people that want to be successful in life. Pursuit also aims for the goal your trying to influence. When planning goals, is the most valuable thing to achieve. There must always be a plan towards the target you aim. Majority of the people, look for something easy they can achieve in their future goal and that is how they succeed.

Finally, the key to being successful in life is by achieving it. To be honest, I do not agree about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of improving. Many people find success by putting in effort and time towards big things. It is not to late to start pushing yourself to be successful and being something in life. Therefore, is it not an important role that failure plays in pursuit of success, and to achieve the plan to succeed ",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.5,2.9,1
3637,F4F054797227,"I believe that people yes should make their own decisions and follow their instincts because that is what make us different from others. Follow your intincts and what you think that it is right can make a big change in what you are and what you want to be.

First. People need to believe in themselves and do what they think that it is right. Sometime we are afraid to make ours onw decision because we think that is wrong or because what others can think about us. But just think about, all the things that people had been invented along the time. What would will happend if they did not make their onw decisions, nothing that what we have today will not exist. So do not be afraid to make your onw decisions because others. Is not bad to look what other had been done and see if what you are about to do can be good or not. But always follow your ideas and do your onw work.

The instincts is a natural aptitude that human have, is something that make us do things without a well reason. The instincts make us do things that we think are right because a felling that we felt. No matter, sometime that felling can be rigth or not. But sometime bad decisions teach us what we do wrong and learned how do it better in a future. people should follow their instincts and ideas because that is what make us defferent. Learn of what we do wrong make us a better person. Poeple always are going to judge you and talk about your decisions no matter if are good or bad. So do not let others stop you and doing the things that you believe are right.

The decisions that we make today can harm us in the future. That may be is right, but if we always are thinking about what is going to happend. we never are going to know what is really going to happend. So make own ours decisions can make a big change ir our life for good or bad. It is important to listen to experts because can be helpful in what you are abuot to do. But always do it because you want to do it, not because other tell you. Always do may make you happy, no metter if you are wrong or not because that is what is going to make the difference.

In conclision yes people should follows their instincts and ideas. But also make their own decisions. Never stop doing that things that they like. Always do and follows what they believe and think carfully and what they want and where they want to be.

First, if you studied a career that you like before and now you dont like it, you have another options or opportunities to take another career for example, I have a friend she is 22 years old, she will to graduate the next year at the age of 23, she is very young and she is thinking to take another career that make her more professional.

They can study and work at the same time and earn money to pay his or her college, they can start a family while they are taking another career and if they learn a lot of things they have their own life.

An afterschool homework club would be nice to have because they get better grades, they could study more, and they could understand the subject better

First of all, they get better grades by helping each other on their homework and they can socialize to know more people, make new friends. Plus they can make up stuff they haven't done at all and have a zero in their grade. It also benefits in all ways, you could get straight As by just taking 1-3 hours extra hours of your day and putting the work into it.

Next, they could study more. Studying more could be a benefit because better test grades, better quiz grades, etc. Also they could get ahead on their classes by doing extra homework and normal work. If you never study you could start by considering to join this club. It could be loads of fun if you make it fun.

Therefore, they could understand the subject better by getting someone to help them. Doing loads of extra work to get your grade up and understand it better. They could help each other out and could achieve their goal of getting to understand the difficult subject.

People don't conseve their energy and resources in the way that people get tired daily. Nonetheless, there are some businesses had the idea to work four days per week each day consistenting of ten hours. As well as, schools should follow this project by extending the school day two hours. In my opinion, school should follow this great idea because students can do differents routine, be less stressful, and get better grades.

To begin with, the majority of students do the same rutine daily some enjoy to play sports on the school. Whereas, someone will like to try another kind of sport outside the school but they don't have sufficient time to do it. Elsewhere, if the school follow extending the school day and leaving one or two days off students can do different rutine and have thier own space. All in all, students can try different sports with their families or friends outside of school. In others words, doing differents routine will help the energy and resources for students.

Second reason, for some students is stressful go to school everyday. As well as, some has to work to late, or do homework, or has problent to get sleep at night. If this happend during this time they loss their energy and is difficult for student to focus on their class. However, students that are stressful can have health problem. In other case, students can be less stressful and active if their sleep more such as, if they get two days off of the school they can repose their tiredness and get energy.

Lastly, the energy and resources are a important priority for a student. Likewise, that all students do their homework and be on time in their class. nevertheless, the majority of the students has problem be on time or do homework some of them miss school days just because they didn't do their homework. Altogether, durin this days off students can do their homework with resources, patience and dedication. After all, this could help student to have better grades.

To conclude, the priority for people life is to conserve energy and resouces. Rather, we are on time to help our students's health. Lately, doing different rutine will help us to progress and be healthy. If we are healthy we are less stressful we will be with energy.

688,34E4FB64EEBA,"Don't you think that we should be what we are no matter who is around?

Is important that we give or have our own opinion. For me, my opinion is always important because is what it makes me unique, and what I think is that I know that some people is afraid to be what they are. Because they are afraid to the reaction of people that they love, for example the most important person in my life is my mom and she is the center of my life, like my dad... But you know something? I'm nervous about the reaction of them, if I act like I want, If I dress the way I like it, I'm afraid that my family or my friends judge me.

I think that the author ""Ralph Waldo Emerson"", is right. I'm agree with the Idea that he have about the world.

People around us is just looking for something to talk about and if for example, I do something wrong, the friends of my mom will talk about me and in a worst case, my mom will do the same. The world influence a lot in ourself in many ways for example:

You will see people following what other person say if he move to one side he or she will do the same.

When we are little people influence, tellling you to do the same that the other kid is doing. In some schools they don't let you to use imagination, like, you have to do what is there and in my opinion the kids should be free to write or draw what they want. I think that it will help to develop our ideas and be succesful.

Mom always is telling you to be like him or she. That she wish this and that and we are tryinng to do those things and be like they want, that we forget about us and we try to be someone else.

We have many expectations about what we can be, how many things can we accomplish, we make many questions to ourself and we try to be someone that is not us, just to make happy the rest of the people, when we should be looking for our own happiness, life is short, life is now and we have to be what it makes us happy, life doesn't make sense if we live in a place or have people around us that is just stealing our happiness. The world is big and is true that influences, even in our decisions. We have the choice to be what we want. Is our decision, is our opinion, is important to be what we are and not what they want.

There is some people that is not agree with this idea. They think that the world is not trying to make you someone else, that there is not any influence and be what the other people tell you to be, that the opinion don't affect and it shouldn't have any problem to act or be what they want. But, I think that people around us can influence in our decisions, because we don't want that people we love get upset about us. We are always worried about the opinions of the rest and that is a big example of how the world influence about us and in our personality.

We all have have something that it makes us unique and special of be. Everybody have different opinions, and there are some people that want others to follow what they said and is not the way it works. The world have many of good things and bad things but what will happen if we just follow what they said, people that is guiding is thinking that it will have the same or better results, but no, we have different results to the differents situations and that's why is important to be what we are and do what we like, because in that way, we know how to act to the situation and if will be a good thing for us to follow, is very important that we show ourself and get courage to confront many difficult situations.

Depending on the way people are raised they may change their behavior over time. If you are brave enough you can choose who you want to be, and you can guide yourself. Everyone is going trough something at this moment, and these are not always good things. People may experiment terrible incidents that are going to change their life forever.

These events are just going trough your life, and sometimes there is nothing you can do to make it different. All these things may change you character behavior. Anyone's personality is going to change if they are not aware of what they are doing, and these actions will lead you to live horrible moments. At this point you no longer have control over your actions and just doing what you want, maybe not knowing what your character has turned into.

On the other hand; will realize what is going on around their live as they grow up, and they are not afraid to know what is happening, they will use this problems to become stronger. As time passes; they will go trough different issues, experiment different changes, but they just don't pay attention to it, and do what they want. Those people usually have control over their life and decide whether they want to change or not. A lot of people around them will try to hurt make them feel different.

For some people is easy to just not care about anything and just care about themselves, it could be a good thing because not anyone is going to make you feel bad. Over time they become smarter, stronger and tougher, but they also know if they need to change something in their life. They were just raised in a different way and a different place that is why they will act different to the rest of people because they also know what is best for them, when something bad is happening they know how to handle it.

These situations may change anybodies personality and eventually they will become a complete new different person. it just depends on the actions they choose to do and the way they see the world. it could be because of tragedies, maybe many bad people around them, they could change if they wanted to. There is many possibilities and reasons for people to change and it will happen at any given point and when they realize it, they are completely different.

It just depends on the way of your thinking, only you can decide if you want to be different, some people may have a weak or strong mind. Some situations are just defined as drastic events that could happen to you and there is nothing you can do about it if you wanted to make it better, only you know if you can handle it. You can confront it or let it change you. Some people will form their own character, or because they don't know what to do anymore. As log as you are aware of what you are doing, you will know what is best for you.                                       ",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.1,1
999,4CB5C9A9AD5A,"I am not agree with this, because the school hours star at 7 am and end to 2:10 pm, in that time we can work after school, and do other important things that we have in the day, but if the school adopted this rule, the days for the students are gone ,because if the school take that rule , the students are going home from the school at 4 pm, and they are arrive home at 5 pm ,so they don't going to have time for do others things, like work or do the homework ,because they just go home to sleep and do some things that the students have to do in home for help in the house.

But for the work weeks are better because they are going to have more time or one more day for have fun with their family and they don't have any problems because they just have to stay two more hour and they going to have one more day off and that is better for they, because is like that they are working that day ,and they get the same pay and the workers just go to work and then go home.

Except for some students are different because they have to go to the school and they have to get up early ,and after school they have to go at work, that is difficult for some students, because they go in to the work after school like at 2:30 , and go out like at 12:00 am, and they don't sleep nothing the rest of the night, and they come tired to the school but they still come to the school, and they do the work that they have to do in the school, and the home too, so that is why that going to affect the students.

I don't think that this new rule going to benefit the students, that rule just benefit the workers, because they going to have one more day left, and to more hours of work in the day, but for the students they get up early and go out of the school late ,and that is bad because, we don't going to have more time for work, just for study and do home work and sleep, that is all the things that we going to do, if the school adopted that rule the day for students are going to be gone for them.

2792,CC149CD4B584,"In this paragraph I will write about how students can take classes from their homes and if they are going to do good in the works that the teachers give to the students on online, talk to the cousolers or tho his admistrator, the students will have some benefit, Students will have benefits with the grades.

If the student offer distance learning, First he must have to talk to his counsoler about doing classes online and disscus with her about he can stay home and do the classes online. Second, the students have to take test before they do the classes online because the teachers or another people from the school can see if he really is going to do the work at home and be prepaed for all the work that the teacher will give to him/students. Finally, the teachers will see and talk to his counsoler or administrator if they do good in the test and see if they can saty at home and do the classes online also the teacher should give a recomendation to the students if they have to take classes online.

The students will have some benefits if they take classes online, First, the students obiasly will have benefit because they will be doing all work at home and they can ask for help to his/her brothers or sister at home and they can help to do the work and if they have a test in the class that he is taking he will pass because he can see the notes or some works that he finished before. Second, They will have benefit because they are not going to school and he can go out during the day and also do the work when they're out. Finally, Students also will have benefit because they can do the work whenever they want bacuse if they have the classes online at the computers is more easier for example, if they only have to take notes they only can see another attachment of the same thing and if they have a test they will see the notes or another paper about the test.

Students will have benefits with the grades. Firts, the students will have good grades because they will have a lot of time do the work that is assigment for the next day or the same day and they will be concentrate because they are going to be alone at home. Second, The students will have a lot of benefit in that because they can see some work abouth the assigment and have a 100 points in the assigment or if they have a project that the students who are in the school they only will have a hour to do it because the others teacher will give a lot of homework to them but the student whp is taking classes online he will have a lot of work too bute he will have all the day to do it or the next day.

In conclusion they can't take classes online because they will have a lot of benefits that the students who is going to school and they can sleep a lot and the regular student has to wake up early and they can't have benefit with grades or other benefits,

In my opinoin students should not to take classes online because that is going to be more easy than the stduent who take classes at school becuase the students who is in the school they are not going to have he same benefits as the students who take classes online.",4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.2,1

There are many ways programs like this can help older kids in many ways. One thing they can learn is to learn to help other people by showing them how to do there work or also teach them how to ask a teacher for help when needed. Another thing that the older kid can learn is to talk to people without being scared or shy this can also help them by getting a job when they grow up. Talking to the young kids can help them learn about the kid and how they act in class and around other people.

It can also help younger students in many ways. One thing it can help them with is learning new thing from the older kids somethings they can learn from them is like how to do math,homework, and how to act in the middle of class without being rude to the teacher. It can also help them learn how to respect others like there parents,teacher,and the older kids. It can also teach them how to talk to other people without being scared or shy to talk with someone or i front of the class.

Programs like this can help both young kids by making new friends with the older kids or talking to other kid and making friends that way.

This can also sat that the person think's you are loyal and trustworthy and that they can believe in you more then they already did. Yes is may hurt the person feelings,but, you are there to help them get though it and make them feel OK.

When being honest with people it can build up trust with you two because they know that you can talk about things without lying. This can also effort how they see you as a person. Even if the truth hurts them they know that you were able to tell them what was happening or if someone was saying something bad about them. This can also build up trust and build up friendship and relationship. People don't like it when you lie to them because it hurts them and makes them feel bad about them self.

Honesty can change how people view you as a person. They can even see if you would be loyal to them when they need you the most. They can also see if your a real friend or something more with being honest. This can also give you respect that you want or need. When I said they would view you different I meant by your personalty and how you are as a person.

Yes, honesty can hurt them,but, lying hurts the most. Why I'm saying this because honesty can hurt but it make them feel better because they have someone they trust and believ them, a real friend.

2435,B4CF5269C465,"Is it a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early?. Some students take courses during the summers or in the evenings or may not be able to take elective courses that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. It would be a bad idea as students need more preparation before go to college, because students need advanced classes, time to know what they want and get more opportunities that help them in college.

Some Students dont be prepared go to college when they graduated. because some people know college is more difficult than schools. for example: My sister graduate early to high school and go to college, when she take the test she dont know the answers; because ask to her about classes that she never see in high school, she lost the test and she had to pay for take that classes before to start with her profession. Is it not a good idea to graduated early as students can get all credit in high school and star to take more advanced classes that they need to college.

Some students take one year more in high school to take advanced classes. For example: my best friend dont have the money to pay college and they want to get a scholar ship in high school, he has all the credits and sol's that he need to graduate, but he take another year; because he want to take advanced classes like physics or difficult classes that he need in college, and is it opportunity to learned classes that you need in college free. but if a students have just three years to graduated when they go to college they dont know nothing classes that they really need.

It would be a bad idea to allow students to graduated in three years as they dont be prepared to the college. students need to experiment elective classes and find what they want because some students when graduated dont know what they want to do after graduated. some people said is better go to college one year early and be professional early however a good professional is not who get all diplomas early is who have the more experience and know more about that.

In conclusion, allow students to graduated early is a bad idea. students need prepared more before go to the college and get time to take the opportunities to take advances classes or get scholar ships that they really need in college.

2773,CB4C85EFAE67,"The author Waldo Emerson wrote a statement or quote that it say ,""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" basing on my point of view or experiences, I agree with him, I think the same, we will never grow if we keep doing the samething that we already mastered.

I'm taking this position on this issue becasue I have my reasos to sopport my position and to explain why this author is right.

First reason is on point of view if you're already mastered in something and you're keep doing it , to be better or go beyond then my opinion is that you're wasting your time on something unnesesary because you're already mastered , just be happy with what you have and knows a sample are the

Childrens they always wanna something if they have it they want more and more or when they are playing they wanna play possiblely the all day when they realize the day is already gone but they don't care because they think that they have enough time to play so it is the same with us. sometimes we wanna be betters than another people or just feel good but we're wasting our time in somethin that we already mastered.

Secondly the author Emerson show us the true in a quote we can stop doing something that we already mastered we could try to do something else or try to learn something new that can help us in the future of that way we can start growing because we start to learn about differents things so we have more knowledge and we can survive and we can realize or knows how the life looks like. A sample to be a boss you need to know or have more knowledge at least than yours employs or to be amanager you have to know many things.

Finally unless you try to do it better or be better than the rest of the people always is gonna be someone else who is better than you then that time you're wasting doing something beyond than you knows ,use it to teach someone else or learn about some else how to be better in something , teaching someone else or learning from someone else you can start to grow. A example is a old brother he learn about his parents and also teach and care his youngest brother of the way he is starting to growing up because his taking a responsability .The example can show us that we need to about experiences or advices or people who has more knowledge of that way .

In conclusion for these reason and supporting with examples that I wrote, I agree and think the same with The author Waldo Emerson , I took this position because If we try to do something beyond what we already mastered, we will never grow. Also we wasting our time and we could use that time to learn from someone something else what we do not know or teach to someone else about our knowledge . what we can help us to grow or be better in the future concluding I agree with Emerson's statement.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5,3.1,1

In this paper i will argue of how the world is trying to change us day by day, how we get influence by it and end up changing, and how every year that goes by our generation gets worst and worst.

The world is everyday is trying to find a way to make us change, we as humans have stop, and think, what we want for our future? why would i want to be like everyone else? Do i want to be a wealthy person in this society? Do i want to accomplish all my goals?, those are the types of question that we should ask our self, and think deeply, were will we end up on the future following the steps of the rest of the world?, because in this world, if you want successful, you have to be yourself, the world is not going to do it for you.

We get very influence by world, on activities, the way we talk, the way that we dress, the clothes that we use, our religion, and a lot of stuff that if we dont like, or we dont do, we are not cool for the world. A good example is the clothes that we use, if we dont us the clothes and shoes that are trending or popular right now we are not cool for the society, and maybe the reason why we dont use it because, you dont have money, or you dont have time or access to buy or simply you just dont like it, and for the world that means your not cool or cute, because, you dont us a certain clothes, and is shouldnt be like that, because, some people get bully by that and some even get to a depression because they cant afford any of that and is very sad to know that this world is like this.

Sadly, by every year that goes by, our generation get worst and worst, and the reason of that is the world. The world has influence us, in such a bad way that is sad, all the new drugs that are killing people, the war between countries, the new artist that are coming out that just sing about drugs, killing people and sex is of a very bad influence for our generation and sadly if we dont start being our own selves, and start the right stuff, eventually we are going to end up really bad.

some people say that this world is bad, and just gives us bad influence, but they are not right, because is not neccesarly the world, it could be us, letting ourselves get involved or influence in bad stuff,and then say that is the world fault, when is really your fault, for getting involved on bad stuff overall, in the future, i hope that this world changes, because we still have time to do it and is not impossible, i just hope that this generation that is coming up, have the courage to change the world and make it a good friendly world.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.1,1

The proposal of increase the school day two hours has the pros and the cons. I'm against of extending the school day. I know the pro is that way we save more energy and resources but has more cons, to continue I have three clear reasons.

The students to lost one day complete of class, and they needs to learn more of each class material. I think that if the teens study just four-day per week, they will can't to be a good output academic. I have a friend that she studies in another school, her school is not ""common"", And you ask me: ""Why do you tell me ""not common""?"" I can answer you because the school day is similar to the principal question, she study just Monday to Thursday; She told me that is ""cool"" because don't have class on Friday but I think that was ridiculous, I know is funny don't to be class on Friday, is really funny!! but We are need focus in to study, we need to have a purpose that is the school and graduate. Studying four-day to week is not similar than study five-day to week.

Some students have a job after school, if they study two hours more per day to week, so the teen would not to be to work almost per four days. They need to work for pay their phones, their clothes, their rent, their food, etc. My cousin have a job after school , he works 5 or 4 days to week. He works because he need the money. When the class is to finish (He can to work that days), his job's schedule start 4:30pm to 10:30pm, so if the school decide change or increase the two hours per day, my cousin and other teens that have a job, would not to work.

The students need more time after school in their home, because they can to do homework or study any quiz or class materials, even any teens have another class in the afternoon, like to study computer, French, Spanish, Arabic, or whatever language , also study arts, math, ballet or whatever dance that they to prefer. Patty is 15 years old, she is a cute girl, she loves to dance class, her dance class start 5pm to 7pm, her schedule is on Monday and Tuesday. On Wednesday she takes computer and Spanish class the same time that dance class. If the school decide follow this model by extending the school day two hours probably she lost her afternoon class

In conclusion, I think that should not follow the model be extending the school day two hours, because the students lost one day complete of class,lost the concentration and focusing in the class,

would no to get job after school and they would not to study another class after school. ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.5,3.1,1

The next text is about ""The firts impresions can change with the pass of time"". The object is give information to the reader about different things that make that the first impresions change, and how can affect. The text is made with examples and support ideas, that help to understand more the theme. Then tell that the impressions can change anytime.

The first impresions is when you current know at someone or something. It is the first opinion that you mind create, but this impresions or idea can change when you start to know better. When we current know a person, our mind create a idea that can be false or true, but is something that only can know with the time.

The change can affect or can benefit, that means that sometimes we thinks that is good and bad, thinks that is bad and is good. A example of affect is when we buy a car, and these is look like beautiful for autside, but when a mechanical check inside descover that have many damage. A example of benefit is when somebody told you something bad of other person, and when you talk with that person you descover that is false.

The first impresions can change for many reasons that our mind create; for example, false opinion, dissapointment, angry, or autocorrection. All these can have influence when you change your impresions of someone or something. For example, when we are angry all is look like bad or annoying. Other example, when we make a autocorrection of something that we believed that was bad or incorrect.

In my conclusion the firt impresions it's very important, no always going to be good or bad, your opinion going to change. I think when you don't know at someone or something is better wait a litte before make a bad or good idea about it.

Second, some people try to not loss the enthusiasm when they fail at the first time, because maybe they have a good positive and they said that the next time they do not going to fail, so its mean that they not loss the enthusiasm at the first time they fail.

Last one, person get mad by his or her self, cause they think they don't do well, and they get really mad when they fail for a little error they have, but that get that they are learning because the errors that person have made them learn.

Some people said that failure is a bad idea for success. but some people don't loss the enthusiasm as they been falling and that made the person won for those who said that failure is a bad a idea because the person that don't loss the enthusiasm is keep going until they make sure to not fail anymore, and as they been falling they been learning.

Although some says that determine to be idle or inactivity also serve a purpose in the way of one day they will accomplish something even though they are lazy, and people determine to not be idle when they want to accomplish something and when people decide to not being wasting their time without doing anything, inactivity doesn't serve a purpose in the life and in the way of accomplish something

Determine never to be idle is much better because we accomplish more, we make proud our family when we do something great to our life, I have done many things in school and accomplish many goals in my life so my parents always tell me that I make them feel proud of me for all that I have been done even though they said that it is not that easy but they know that I never determine to be idle and I always like to accomplish something in my life.

I always like to accomplish things like having a better grades in school and learn more each day even though some classes are harder than other once but I like to not be idle because if I determine to be idle I may just waste my time doing nothing.

Determine never to be idle is much better because people can growth having a better future in their life,

people can growth having a better job. For example, I want to growth by studying a career and have a better job in the future. Make more proud my family and myself I know it is hard, but all the effort that I put on it right now it will pay it back later, and I will so be thankful to myself to be a person who never determine to idle in life. And it is wonderful how much I had done I never going to regret about what I had been accomplished.

In conclusion, if people never do something in their life, they never will accomplish something that can be a benefit for their future or make their family proud. As Thomas Jefferson said if people determine never be idle they can accomplish and have done what they want to done in their life, and it is wonderful how much people may have done if they always been doing something and don't determine to be wasting their time.

2592,C02F3803D0D1,"People think that first impressions are almost impossible to change. I disagree with that because impressions is just what you think, always make you think different things, and you never know whats gonna happen.

Impressions is like when you thought somethings, its just what you think about someone or something. For example:My impression is that she is not telling me the truth. you think that she's not telling you the truth but you don't know the truth.

Impressions can make you think different or bad just because how you look at someone or something. For example: If you see someone that has a bad looking, your impression is that he might be poor but, you can change your impression if you see that he has the Iphone of the year, or he has a Lamborghini, so it can make you think different.

When women get pregnant they always get impress and trying to guess what the baby is gonna be. For example: When my mom got pregnant and she had me, her impression was that it was gonna be a girl, and she wanted a girl, but here i am, 18 years old, a big boy and she was impress and sad, but when she see that i was very handsome her impression change she's happy now.

Some people believe that just with their impression you are what they say.

Next time you think that the first impression is impossible to change, you have to think the first impression does not say everything about a person or something.

I hope you never impress by something or someone, that can be different that you thought, thats why we dont judge, God is the only one who can judge.",2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.9,1

You never want to say something to your mom or dad that will hurt them or make them feel bad, you see your teacher's every day and come's to school everyday to teach you something and you friends are the one's you spend most of your time with so always have a good attitude.

First, first impression are possible to change when you are making new friends at new school because people can look at you by the way you are quite, shy, and serious. But once they start to get to know you they start realizing that you are talkative, loud, and fun to hangout with. Their first impression of you starts to change. For example, when I met Generic_Name I thought she was ignorant, rude, and selfish but when I started to hangout with her I noticed that she was a sweet and caring girl. And we became really good friends even my first impression of her from the beginning changed.

Second, first impression are possible to change when you go to an interview at work because when you arrive at the interview it may seem that don't have the courage to work by the way you act. Meanwhile those impressions start to change because they notice that you actually want to work and you want to put an effort on the job. For example, When I went to an interview for a job the manager thought that I didn't actually wanted to work and that I wouldn't take it serious just by the way I look. Later on he realized that I actually wanted the job even that I would take it serious. In other hand some people think that by the way I talk or my face impression, people think that I won't get the job because I would not take it serious but they are wrong because once they start to get to know me. They start realizing that I actually want the job.

What do I think about working with people or working alone, I think both have great benefits but it depends on the type of person if they are social, antisocial , or if they been through stuff. But if I was to pick one I would choose to work with a group because of how many advantages their are, if your stuck and you need help you can always ask for help from your group because theres more than one, working with your group is easier than working alone because you can do different parts at the same time meanwhile when you work alone it takes longer, it becomes more difficult if you need help and not knowing what to do. Working together gives us a bigger boost of an IQ because multiple brains are better then one and gives us a better over all grade or if the person that is working alone and is very smart he could find things easier. Working together could be fun because of the people you are working with or meeting new people in the group that you don't know and learning from them and what experience they been through.

Disadvantages are people are going to force the smarter person of the group to do all the work, if people choose the group they'll choose either the smart people of people that they get along with and mess around and not do anything, if the teacher finds out that the smart ones from the groups do all the work they'll get an f. People who choose people to be in their groups are going to abuse their power. People who choosed to work alone would be struggling because work hard and they would have to do all the work, it would be boring and long with no one to socialize, if were stuck you and you needed help no one is there to help.

What can change us can be the people around us, the things around us, and even the friends we make. A other thing that can influence us is our family since DNA can give us some of our parents personally and the way they treat us can change our personally as well. Now other people who say we can chose have their own opinion as well. They think we can choose our own character traits. They say this because once you put your in mind on it you'll be able keep it like that. I also thought this as well but that change because my family and friends were totally different they what I was going for and thats how I became what I did.

Activity means when you are doing something like playing sport, going outside, or participating in some type of competitions. There a lot of activities, you can choose and participate in it. My favorite activity is playing with my friends at national parks. The choice, I chose is playing with my friends at national parks because it keeps you healthy and unstressed.

To start, one reason I chose is that playing outside keeps you healthy. For example, I had one friend like some years ago, but now we don't talk because we kind a faded, so we used to play a lot. One time my health was getting bad because I stayed at home all the time and doing nothing then I talked to my parents about my health and they said that I should play outside with my friends, go somewhere special where you haven't been. Then, I went to the parks and played there tag, played hide and seek, and played soccer. I had fun and after some months, my health got better and I just continued playing those 3 games. It's important because nobody really wants their body to have some problems and then they regret, so that's why you should go outside and play with your friends.

In addition, other reason, I chose is that playing outside doesn't give you a stress. For example, in 2016, I had this big stress about school and about homework and what we do in classroom. I just couldn't focus on my studies and got like bad scores on the test. Then I tried to find the way to get out of the stress and it said that you should go outside, do activities with your friends that you like. I asked my mom about this and she said yes to me then I started to go outside with my friends everyday and I was kept forgetting about my school and homework which was good for me. I didn't have any stress after in 2016. it's important to be not stressed because then it affects on your study and also it affects your health, so that's the other reason, you should go out and hang out with your family and friends.

In conclusion, playing outside helps you not stressed out and keeps you very healthy. As a result pf these reasons will help you in your life and honestly these two reasons are actually reliable, you just have to follow them and there you go, your life will be amazing. Playing outside and doing more activities help you a lot and it doesn't give you any bad day or anything like obviously you don't want any and bad situation to be in your life, so follow them.

For a example if someone is tired and your gunna be like oh their lazy you cant just base them from there firsr impresstions.

Is it impossible to change no its not impposble because it i ur mentality. In life nothing is inpossible you can easily chnage to a whole diffrent lets say, your a very mean person you can always change and be super nice to everyone. You can always change for who you are and for me i was very quiet i would never wanna go talk to poeple because i was really shy with people but now i like to talking to everyone else and i dont care who the person is i always introduce my self.

So i strongly agree with this statement you cannot jude someone by their first impressions some people thought i was really mean when they first met me bcause i would be tired end of the day and i wouldnt walk people because i was lazy and i didnt have that enery to talk. Thats why i changed my mentality so people would not call me lazy because its anoying so thats why i changed my whole life around i didnt wanna be so the same so i just changed, that made me super happy just for having a new life style.

When someone says it is impossible to change their wrong because they dont belive in them selfs that they can change has a new perosn i didnt think i was going to be a whole new diffrent person. and now i do really like who i am always smileing. Back then i would not like to smile i was a really boring person.

1193,5C72AB0B1232,"What's a career? a career is an occupation or a profession that someone do. People can start their career at any time in life. It's a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because career would prepare students for what they want to become in the future, and it can help students learn more skills and experience when they work with others.

Firstly, career can prepare students for what they want to become in the future. Consider someone who wants to become a doctor. People who want to become doctors usually work at the hospital so they can watch how doctors do their work. For example, Generic_Name was a student at Generic_school and he wanted to become a doctor one day. Generic_Name started to work at the hospital after his parents told him that they didn't have money to put him in college. Generic_Name learned a lot of of things about doctors before he went to college; and when he went to college, it wasn't so hard for him because most things about doctors seemed familiar. Generic_Name graduated with a bachelor's degree and he became a good doctor. This proves that committing to a career at a young age can be helpful in the future.

Secondly, Career can help students learn more skills and have more experience of things in life. for example, Generic_Name loves when someone plays guitar and he always say that he wish he knew how to play guitar. Generic_Name was hired after he applied on a part time job which was called "" Teen fun time"". it was a good job for Generic_Name because they could teach him many different things including guitar. Generic_Name was taught how to play guitar by some guy who liked how Generic_Name was a hard worker and nice to everyone. After hard months of training, Generic_Name could play guitar by himself. people loved how Generic_Name played guitar, therefore, his manager made him play at the entrance of the building so people can enjoy while entering the building. Generic_Name was able to draw, paint, and cook after he worked at the Teen fun time for a while. Teen fun time made Generic_Name a good guitar player and a great cooker.

Some people may say that it is not a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because some teenagers turn into disrespectful children to their parents when they receive their first checks. For example, Generic_Name was hired at the boys and girls club. After he received his first check, he could not do anything his parents ask him to do and he would claim that he's going to be late to work. His parents did not like it and it made them unhappy sometimes. However, committing to a career at a young age is good because it teaches teenagers a lot of stuffs they need to know in life. Teenagers also make money from a career, which means that they can help their parents with small needs like buying clothes for themselves and shoes.

In conclusion, a career at a young age prepares students for their future career. If someone want to become a pilot, they have to work at the airport so they can get some ideas on how planes fly. Committing to a career at a young age can help students learn more skills and have more experience on things in life. By working with people, students can learn new stuffs from people they don't know. This proves that committing to a career at young age is good for students.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,1

There are people who go to a specific person who understands them, They go to that person because they feel comfortable with telling them about the problem they need advice on. People usually just go to one person because either they're really close to them or they give good advice for the problems they have.

But there are people who take advice from multiple people, They take advice from different people because the more advice the different outcomes you would get on your situation. Some people will give bad or good advice if you think about it, Its good to hear from other people because they will tell you somethings you didn't think about before.

If you take advice from just one person its only one outcome, But if you take advice from different people the more outcomes the better because different people give you good advice it will boost your confidence even if it backfires with confidence the different people gave you it wont't affect you that much so it better to take different people for advice.

So if you wanna take someones advice its better to take it from multiple people to get a perspective on how things would go, the more advice you get the more you see into your problem or problems you have.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1
2241,A79D997C4B42,"Working with a group has more benefits then working alone because with a group you can all help each other and learn new things, also so people can be more social and you can get the work done faster and aso there can be some pressure . When you work alone it can get very boring and you may need help with something but also if you are working alone you can work at your own pace. With a group you may be pressure to finish something quicker but your teamates can help you with that. When someone is in a group they can act silly at times and give the teacher or the boss a headache but, when they focus they can get work done faster. Working with a group is not just for the work, it is for people to be social and so people can see how they act around other's. You can learn new things with other people that you did not already know or you can teach them something but at some point the whole group teaches everyone somehting new.

Working in a group you would probaly be pressured to stop being foolish and get your part done but if you have nice teamates then someone can help you with your part. Some people, perfer to work alone because they do not like to be pressured for no reason but in some ocasions those people are the one's to turn in late work or has incorrect information. In a group they correct you if you did not do something right and hellp you out if you ask for help and someone can help you becuase that's what a group is for to help each other learn new things. If a due date is coming up there can be so much pressure because maybe you have not even done your part or you are just lazy to do it some your teamates start to get mad at you and you do not know what to do.

Learning new things can be fun with a group because you might not be shy to ask questions so you learn new things and maybe someone else from your group learn that same thing as you. If the group learn's something new then they can use that thing in the future when they work alone or with a different group. Helping each other is one of the easiest way to get done with something but working alone you may take longer because you have to search up things and some times they do not know where to start.

Teachers put students in a group to see how they act around each other like if they act goofy or if they do not have self control. When working with a group there has to be self control because if the group is just being goofy then they would not get work done and they can get a bad grade and not work together in that class ever again. The teachers see how the students act and they see who should be with who and who should not be with someone. Working alone the teachers know that it will be quite and they would not know how the students act with friends around or a group.

Working together is way better then working alone because you become more social and not so much of a shy person. A group can also help you focus and have a good time all at once, also they can hep with having a good grade in that class because they helped you a lot. Students learn new things when they working with people and they might not be so shy. Working in a group has more benefits then working alone because working alone you have to do everything on your own and with a group they can all help.",3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,1

Every country, every school, every teachers have teaching for students how to working together to playing games on assignment.

Why we need to teaching them the way like that? If we did not teaching the students working with a group, what happen will be?

Almost the students really like working alone than working with a group. Because they think they can give some idea bad, and they don't want somebody complain when they do something wrong. If parents or teachers don't teaching them working with a group and believe by them self, they will never successful on the way they are. When Bill Gate was young, him learning about software and computer, when him did not have more idea. Bill Gate told friends about working with him, Bill Gate said: We could be create something new about software and computer. After two years, they could be create the new computer and software. Five years later, Bill Gate become rich people in the world. If Bill Gate did not told friends working with him, than we never know about software and computer like him created that. Bill Gate said: If the war appears, you did not working together, your country will be lost.

Why we necessary to working with a group? Because working with a group might be make your love each other and understand when you work. When a group understand each other, they would be do some project better and always will be on time. Like a company they never have one people working in there, because one people could not be do some project better a group. Every people working in company, they never working with alone, because they don't know where you fail when you writing essay.

If you like working with a group, you can learning skill about your friends, you will be easy to successful on the goals.

If you like working with a group, you will be have more friends and second language if your friends from another country.

In life things aren't easily handed to you if you want something bad enough you have to work hard for it if you wanna become a better version of yourself. Most people around the world look up to certain successful people and wish to become just like them with all the money, cars, and fame like the famous rapper "" Nba Youngboy "" which has made himself known through his music rapping about his life and difficult obstacles he's had to go through to make it where he is now.

Growing in life and being successful isn't something that's going to happen over night it takes time and patience. With every task comes a difficult obstacle that'll try to put you down and make you wanna give up and people usually tend to give up easily. The only way you can over come obstacles and move forward is to get up from it and keep trying; Barack Obama one of our best well liked President worked hard for what he believed in and helped illegal immigrants around the country get an opportunity to get job legally. Obama had many difficult task but his passion and what he believed in never made him wanna give up he kept trying over and over again to grow and to help undocumented immigrants voices be heard too.

Immigrants nowadays tend to have it harder than most people; they come from around the world looking for a better life, well paid jobs, and a safe home for their family. The majority of immigrants come with nothing but a couple clothes and shoes and usually no where to stay more than half of immigrants work twice as hard to get food on the table and clothes for their kids and wifes. The mindset of having goals and being passionate about something is a powerful tool, Many immigrants work hard enough to eventually become a U.S citizen which has a lot of obstacles to complete. For immigrants to learn the english language is difficult but after studying and working hard long hours they master it and they tend to grow in the american society, Which shows anyone if you really put your head into it you can accomplish anything.

The students may have to reschdule some of the things that may have to do after schools end and some student can't changed there schdule at all also more stress can happen to the students.

Some student have things to do after school like they have a jobs go to after school ends, I have a friend that has a job he go to after school end and to go right away or he will be late for work that can lead to him fired. I have art school after schools ends and I need to be there on time to finish part of my art work that help me get in to college. Some of the student may have go to an importent event that has a time on it like a funeral in a diffrent state and that can lead to get behind in class work.

More work may over stress the student mind and they might fall behind in things that might be inmported, the student may have less time to sleep to get work done on time beacuse there schdule maybe get more cramp with work to do, then they were before the school have added one more hour of school day. And the classes may have more work to do in class that can lead to more stress to the students and more homework to finish off at home.

Sure when students become an college students and adults they have more thing to do in there schudule then a student in high schools.

They are going to be happy because they choose the classes that he have the chance to choose the classes for themselves.

Some students have a program that pairs older students with younger students. The older students are available to assist the younger students.

Is good that the students go to the schools but most will be the one's that are in the middle schools for what for nothing is good that the students that are in middle schools they are going to high school because they can talk with the teachers about the class and what is going to be about.

Can be good for some students because when get's the time to go to high school they can be sure what is going to be about the classes the he choose and all that stuff.

2940,D371D73ACCC2,"Some People Believe in praising a student's work to build self-esteem,even if the work is not the students best effort. they believe that students must be self confident to learn.

I do not, i believe that if you give a student false praise then the student is going to get lazy & stop producing work with the quality and efficiency that they used too.

In truth I was just like this, I once had a teacher who put so much false hope and praise in me that i started to not care as much as i used too, it effected my social life & determination as well as my standards, intent & self-esteem, I was no longer able to spend more than five minutes on work without getting distracted or discouraged, eventually i came to terms with the fact that not all my work was gonna be perfect, but if i spent enough time on it then it would be a hundred times better.

So what is the best way to build self-esteem, well that would be hard work and dedication, lots of people think that just because they do some work they should instantly be rewarded, there work does not even need to be good, for them to think they deserve praise.

The best way to actually build confidence is through achievement's,when you accomplish something and you do it well you get this since of success unlike the half baked work most people get credit for.

Once you actually build up confidence everything in life gets easier, you start doing your home work on time, when a test comes up you would be very well prepared to get an A, your friends and teachers start to respect you more & your parents will be proud of you, but most importantly you will be proud of yourself.

In conclusion having false praise & hope is bad it lowers your standards and makes your work ethic terrible the only good way to build self-esteem is through achieving something out of hard word and dedication.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.3,1

FIrstly, the person will be able to know which one is the best choice to go with. I have exprienced it when I make a wrong choice. One time, I planned to clean the car. Than, I asked my parents about it, and they said that You should not clean the car because there is a lot of different diseases that are in the car. I said to myself that my parents are right because I can be sick, tired, and can have different kinds of diseases. Then, I decided that I will not going to clean the car. It is better to ask advise from the people that are your friend or family. Moreover, it will help you to make better choice in your life. One time, I decided to play video games with my friend, and I actually had a test after that day. My friend just ask me that if I have a test. I told him that yes I do have test tomorrow, then he give me an advice that you should not play any video games tonight because video games can make you tired, bored, and can't think about your question in the test. When I thinked to myslef that if I play video games, I will not be able to think on my test the next day of it. I recommend to ask good people fo an advice.

Secondly, the person will find their next step. I have exprience that when I don't find my next step, I would ask for advice from other people. Once, I did not know how to do my next step my math assighnment. I asked my friend that should I multiplie or add, she showed me a trick for an easier way to always find your step when you are stuck on that kind of question. I likly use that trick trick, and I mostly find my step. I recommend that a person will have to ask for advice if they even know the answer. In addition, there was a time that my sister had a problem with her next step. It was an important assighnment so I did'nt help her but, I give some advices and that helped her a lot to, fix her step thet she was stuck. I will say that a person should ask people for an advice.

Lastly, the person will stop thinking about their choice too much. I have expreinced it when I think about my choice so much. Once, I had a choice that I could take the Mock writing SOL or I could get the original and a higher level writing SOL. I always thinked which one should I go for, and one day I was angry for no reason and that was because of how much I thinked about which one I should go with. I asked my dad about this and he said that you should take the original because this is a challenge for you. Additionally, I said to myslef that if I get this writing SOL and if I pass this, my parents ahould give at least a gift and I said to my dad that this challenge is great. Again, I recommend people to ask advice from someone to know and research more about something.

In conclusion, people somtimes talk to more than on person because they will be able to know which is the best choice to go with, to find their next direction, and that person will have to extract his thinking about their choice too much. Consenquently, I would always recommend to ask an advice from a person you know or knows the best.",3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.4,1
1081,52D0FED6AF38,"Many people debate about this topic since one of the most known scientist said this statement. A lot of people agree and disagree, and from my knowledge, I agree. Imagination is something that everyone has, not everyone has knowledge. Imagination can lead you to imagine things that other people haven't. This is how many scientist got fame by just thinking about new things.

With imagination you can think about a new type of computers, new math formula, or a new type of material that hasn't been invented yet. Many scientist invented new stuff from just thinking about new formulas or experiments that they could to make something new. There's also things like the periodic table, that the scientist who made it spent days and nights just thinking about new substances and materials, when he went to sleep, he dreamed about new substances that later on got on the periodic table.

Thinking about things in places you shouldn't, like school, could either lead you success and give new things to do and study, or low grades because you weren't paying attention, must of the times is the second option. Thinking is most of the times in math, where you have to do a hard equation and think and do a lot of work. If you like to think, that might be your favorite class and you will get good grades. Getting good grades in math is really good, it means that you have a good memory and you can easily learn new things (it usually means that when you can do a lot of problems without having difficulty).

Imaginations can also give you knowledge, when you think, it opens a new whole world of ideas. You can basically do anything you want. You can basically experiment with anything you want, but you might not get the right answer or the thing you expected but you will also learn why. These type of things can also help you to learn why something did or did not work as planned. It also helps you think about stuff that you could or not do in real life, for example doing something that is ilegal and you shouldn't do. It also helps when you think a rule or a law is dumb, you can thing what could happen if you did it, that could work to see why it's a rule.

Imagination is something that everyone has and everyone can use without a limit. Using it can lead to a lot of stuff, such as success and making new things. Knowledge is something not everyone has and not everyone can use, imagining can lead you to learn new stuff without doing much effort or risking to do it in real life and might get in trouble by doing it.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.4,1

While some people around the world say that teachers should design the summer project for the students. It is better for the students to design their own summer project because they have better ideas, Can make their projects less stressful, and make it more fun with their friends.

All students in the world have better ideas to how to design your own project and make it better. Students have better understanding of what they want to do for there project like having better ideas and knowing what they want to work on. Cristiano Ronaldo wrote a article about why is good students should design their projects and why teacher should let them design their own article. Cristiano Ronaldo is a soccer star but he went to high school and know what the students want to do and design. He wrote on the article that students brain is still developing;he said that if students keep making their own decision and teachers let them choose their designs of projects they can come up with better ideas that other people cannot even think about. In the article he wrote that we students have a amazing brain and we can come u with the best ideas and design of projects that no one else can't. Everyone keep saying that teachers should make the designs of students projects for the summer.

Students of everywhere can make there project design less stressful if they get to choose what they can do. When students get to design there own project is less stressful for them because they can choose how they want to do it.

Leonel Messi came to every high school in the united states to talk about how stressful is when teacher give students projects over the summer. They make us work super hard and is super hard to communicate with their teacher over the summer. He talk to us that picking our own projects is way better than teachers picking the design because we can make our own ideas and it is less stressful and that is going to be easier. When students pick their design they don't need to worry about asking question to their teacher and stressing out. Messi told us that when he was in high school,he used to choose his own design of project because it was less stressful and more fun to do. when people keep saying that teacher should choose our design it so stressful because us as student want to choose our design for our summer project.

People in all high schools keep saying that is more fun for students to make our design of project ,because it makes our studies more fun and incredible. The mother of my friend ones told me that there is nothing more fun than getting to design a project as a student. She told me that when she was in high school their teacher choose the project for them and that wasn't fun for no student. That's why she told me that is more fun to get to choose your own design of project because when teachers get to choose them is super boring and stressful students sometimes cry. She told me that If i had the chance to make my own design to take it because it was not going to be fun to if the teacher choose the design. It is going to be more fun if you get to choose your own design for the summer project because i can get to make it with my friends and probably family members. Never let your teacher choose design the summer project for the students.

While other people might say that these summer projects should be teacher designed because the student keep learning more and keep working hard;however, if students make their own summer project design it is way better because student have better ideas, less stressful, and get to have more fun while doing the project. Messi gave us a great talk about how to choose your own design of project can make every students less stressful. Students around the world have a ruff time trying to do projects that their teacher gives them over the summer. Teachers should let students choose their own design so students can relax and have fun over the summer and they can keep doing there project and still have time to have fun with family and friends. Every student around the world should start making their own design for their project.        ",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.1,1

Should people make their own decisions, or shoud they seek guidance from experts and authorties.

If you take decisions, you can have a good life for you'r future. For Exmaple if you want go to the College but you talk with your self and said no go to the college because you not are Intelligent, so you try to deisions go to the college or not go.

you can take your own decisions,For Example: if you take one decisions are bad or no the people need to repect you'r decisions because is you'r decisions,So They not want to know why you take that decisions in my opinion the people only want the bad for you.

You can take more control about you'r decisions,For Example: you can have more control about you'r decisionsFor Example:you can have more control about you'r decisions if you control you'r decisions you can take good decisions and that is good for take decisions

So, you need to have contro about decisions.

you can have you'r own decisions is good to take you'r decisions because you have more capacity to take other decisions, So in my opinion is good to have a decisions because can help to you in the Future but if you take something good for you'r life or for decisions.

In Conclucion: Should people make their own decisisons, or should they seek from experts and Authories. Take decisions for you is good because you can have good life for the future,if you want go to the college but you talk with you'r self and no go to the college because you not are Intelligent, so you try to decisisons go to the college or not go.

Writting SOL Grade 8

Before, I would always like to try and play the guitar. My brother would always try and teach me, Everytime I hear the guitar, it makes me feel calmed. Also when I was in Elementary School, I used to live in Generic_City, VA. The school I used to go to was named Generic_School. In Generic_School I used to be in band, so I would play the flute. I always tried to play the flute. I would never give up in something that I like or something the was my passion. Though, later on in middle school, when I went to 6th grade, I got in chorus. Once I got in chorus I thought I would hate that class of chorus, but later on I noticed I cannot stop singing. I always like to sing along with music or people. I am glad that I got in chorus in 6th cause I found out myself what I like to do, and what I like to do is sing. Even though, what I still would like to do is learn how to play the guitar and the flute. Doubt I can learn, but I can always try to play hem or one of them.

Another, thing I like to do is workout/exercise. Doing workout/exercise relaxes me a lot and makes me forget about a lot of family problems. I used to be in boot camp. I was in bootcamp when i was in 7th grade then I in 8th but I had to quit for a very obvious and hurtful reason. That reason is that my keee cap is out of place. I was suppost to get surgery, but my mom dosen't have that type of money to pay the surgery. Now, all i do is take pills that my doctor is recommending me but i think they are making me worst but I take them cause I have too. Sometimes, they make my pain go away or they make my pain feel worst to the point where i fall in the floor. I don't really know what they are doing to me. Although I hope I get better by 9th grade cause I want to join the junior army that is at Generic_School. I always wished to a nurse or going to the army, thought sometimes I feel like if I go to the army I would get hurt real bad in there. Even if I worked as a nurse in a hospital, I don't think I would fit right in. I feel like i can disgusted easily but I still want to help people, but I doubt 'll fit right in. I don't think i'll have a great future. I can always try to get what i want all i gotta do is work hard, and ill be able to accomplish the future I want and i've been thinking of, i just gotta do the right thingand also at the right moment.

Hopefully one day everything I want to accomplish now that I can't do i hope I accomplish it in the future and i hope it turns out good too. The wishes i have of playing the guitar,flute, my knee cap getting better, joining the junior army, get in the actual army or just being a nurse I hope I can do all those in the future. I want a great big beautiful and wonderful future. I want to make my family be proud of me for once in forever. When all those have I accomplish by the future im going to look at the ones who would bully me or say things about me and just say what happened to you? I know for a fact if to accomplish those goals in the future they will become true. Some day ill be looking down at people who put me down even when I in a good place.

In the future i also want to play soccer or basketball in 6th and in 7th i sould love to play basketball. I woukld always go outside and go to a basketball court and takemy basket ball sometimes with some friends to play with or sometimes it used to be with my step dad. I have never tried playing soccer cause playing soccer looks hard to do but some say playing soccer isvery easy, thought it dosen't look like it. I have played with my brother before but i'm always scared that my brother is going to kick the ball too hard and accidentaly hit me. Hoping this summer i go to the store andbuy meself a soccer ball and a basket ball for the summer to go out and play. Maybe with my brother to play soccer or even to play basketball but i doubt so i don't even know. I'm not very good atr basket ball, but i sure can throw good in the hoops.

Also always wanted to be a professional coach in basketball but for that I need a lot of practice and me trying hard but I also want to focus in school. Though what i really suck in school is Math, Civics and Science and I don't know how to get better in those three claases i try too but I always fail and always get and F or a D. I don't know really how to bring my grades up in those three classes. Yet i still look fordward a amazing future that i probably cannot have. Even thought what I said, I always got to try on something that i want or else i cannot get it. That's why I always got to try on it. Hopefully bringing my grade up can help me on something cause i really need to bring up my grades i've been getting close too in other classes lately but in those three I can't. In the future I will just not now cause I can't jus try i can't say yes i can knowing i cannot at all. I wish i can ask for help but I am always scared to ask teachers in frony of everyone else so I leave teachers notes witch is ver y emberrassing but at least im trying to bring up my grade. I'm just trying to make my family proud for once in a while. I will not only make them proud cause i'll also make myself proud, and look up and thank god for helping and thank my dad that is in heaven that is right now watching me hopefully.

I have so many wishes and dreams in the future that I am looking fordward too, but i don't even know if i'll be abke to accomplish it and make it.

All im looking fordward too is to accomplish everything and make people happy and proud of me and im trying to be proud of myself and feel like myself for once in a while. All i gotta say is that, no one should give up on their dreams or on what they want to do cause i know everyone can do it and they accomplish there dreams, you can always make everythinmg right you just need the riht moment and need for us to be strong and do it. Never give up on big dreams like these. Everyone should try to make the best out of you.",3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,1
3707,F7CBE1D11BF8,"Is true self-esteem caused by self-confidence or is it caused by achievement, are people right about what they believe that; self-esteem is caused by self-confidence or is self-esteem caused by achievements? Self-esteem is caused by achievements, although some people may believe self-esteem is caused by ""self-confidence"". I personally believe, self-esteem is caused by someone's achievement. By personal experience my self-esteem is caused by my own achievements.

True self-esteem is caused by achievements for example: We can say, an employee at Chipotle has recently been elected ""employee of the month"". People may say "" what does that have to do with self-esteem?"" It does have to do with self-esteem because, that person has recently been elected employee of the month, and is being rewarded for his achievement of being elected employee of the month for his hard work. Although some people may believe that; self-esteem is caused by self-confidence. I personally still believe achievement is prior to self-confidence, and it's the cause of someone's self-esteem like; being elected employee of the month, that is one feeling of satisfaction that person had for being elected employee of the month.

Next, it is possible that self-esteem could be caused by self-confidence. For example: there may be students that can't start off their day learning without feeling confident about themselves. They may not want to learn, because they don't feel the positive energy or enough knowledge to be able to cope with how they're feeling that day; whether they want to learn or they don't want to learn. Also, for example: I have a friend who can't learn if she doesn't feel confident. She starts distracting others around her, she starts interrupting class, because it is hard for her to focus and learn when she doesn't feel confident. Although some people believe in praising a student's work to build self-esteem. I still believe in achievement being prior to self-confidence. Because in my opinion the second the student is done being praised; they will immediately go back to not feeling self-confident to start their day learning.

Finally, true self-esteem is profit to achievement. There is a vast of people around the world being praised for their achievements. Achievements include; If you're being praised for something good you've done like: getting a job, becoming employee of the month, helping someone by carrying their groceries to their car, if an elderly has tipped over in the street and need help getting up, these are the causes of true self-esteem. For example: Last year 2018 at my old school, Generic_school our cheer team felt true self-esteem to find out they had made it to finals. Making it to cheer-leading finals was a vast achievement for them, because it had been 5 years since our team had won finals.

In conclusion, true self-esteem is caused by achievement. By personal experience I can conclude that achievement plays a huge role in having self esteem, because my true self-esteem is caused by my own achievements, and due to others personal experience true self-esteem is caused by their achievement. Although some people may believe that; self-esteem is caused by ""self-confidence"". I personally believe, self-esteem is caused by someone's achievement.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.4,1
3343,E770240CAEE1,"The first impression that is impossible to change,is surpise. Because in the life always we learn somenthing new,for example,when I start in the first job and don't know anything, I need to learn the things that,I need to do rigth. One example,when I work in the kitchen,so I need to learn the ingredients,the plate name and how to make. After that I can start. Then, I want to change the work,because I tired of the chefs,fire,bad manager or bad pay, and I can look for another job.

Now I start again,because I take a different job like a Secretary. Now I to learn new things,because I not work with food again, now I start with papers, computers and minister calls.

So this is the Surprise,the life change all the time,but we need to have positive attitude and face up to all the bad things that coming.

Is the same with the school, some times the attitude change,because is impossible that somebody knows all the information about one class or two. We have differents impressions impossible to change. Because some people hate some class, for example math, but some liked. Normally I hate this class, because is just number,equations,square rules. I disagree with this class, but I know that in the future I need. But all we have differents positions, because some people love the numbers and others love another class for example, I like History why. The reason is that I like learn new things that I don't know, is very interesting.

But, I agree with one thing, all the class are very important for my life, because in the future I can take any job because I know differents things for differents carrers and I can help to other people in any class.

We are agree in one thing. Wherever we going always the school is very important in our life. I know that we can disagree in differents things,but I think that is impossible to change the scary impression why, because always we scary to fail but, I agree that we can fight for change the future and achieve everything that we want.",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.5,2.0,2.5,2.8,1
2687,C6555F21F7CD,"I believe that Winston Churchill's quote,""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"", is true because after you make the mistake you learn how not to make that mistake again. The only way to learn how to be successful is to make a mistake. I think that you should always isten to your elders because they have been threw rough and happy days. When we are little, we always think that our parents are being really strict, but they're only trying to keep us happy.

I have made alot of mistakes when I was a pre-teen and I still make mistakes now,but at the end i realize that I was wrong. I was thirteen when I got my first phone and my parents always told me to not have social media till i'm sixteen. The only reason why my parents said,""no"", to social media was because they didn't want me to get hacked by people. All though, my parents said no to socail media i got it anyways. After couple weeks of having social media, someone decided to hack my snapchat. At that point, I realized my parents were always right.

My parents have made mistakes before too. When I waa a baby, my parents took me to my grandparents house for the first time. After we got to my grandparents home, my parents forgot to close the door behind us. So, I crawled out of the house and they didnt see me. After that, this guy saw me crawling down the streets and there were cars driving by me. So, the guy carried me to his shop to see if anyone comes to find me. After couple minutes, my mom realized I wasnt there so she ran out of the house to find me and than couple blocks down she saw in someones shop. My parents always checked if the door was closed after that incident.

Always keep in mind that you shouldnt do anything without thinking of the affects. If you not sure if its right or wrong, then you should ask someone for their opinion. If that doesn't work out than your probably doing something wrong. If you do something wrong then people will change the way they look at you. It better to keep in mind that your family and friends have faith in you.                                                      ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.1,1
876,4353BF70C4A3,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Schools goal is to offer for students classes from home to make sure students do their best in order to pass and graduate. Students would be benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students love the idea of taking their courses at home, will have more time to do any activities they could not do in school day time, and its more easier.

First, students love the idea of taking classes at home because students do not have to wake up early for school, that give students more time to sleep and all of us know how important to get your daily hour sleep on our brains. Also, it's good for students who are shy for what ever reasons. I know someone who took classes at home for third and fourth quarters, so he didn't have to go to school. The classes he took started at six PM every Monday and Wednesday. This guy told me that online classes were helpful for him and made him pass.

Second, students will have more time to do any activities. Schools started at eight AM and ends at three PM. At this time, students could do any thing like working in the morning time or help parents in anything or do anything else. Students could use this seven hours to do anything that may help them in the future. As I said before, online classes start at six PM and ends at eight PM. Generic_Name, my closest friend, took classes at home, so he could work and get money.

Students take classes at home at home because it's more easier. Many students said that is better to take our classes at home because it's more easier and teachers teach in really simple way that make anyone understand than what school do. Students wants to pass so they takes the easy way that the school offer to pass, and as I said before, schools offer distance learning to make students succeed. Generic_Name, one of my best friends, took online classes, and he told me that's his teacher was really good because of the way that the teacher taught them back then, makes everything easier and simple that even a kid could understand it.

Schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home not just because it's easy or can attend it from home. Schools goal is to make sure we succeed on this classes, and that's what schools here for. Is to open the way for us to create the future because if students are 20% of our present, they are 100% of our future.

1930,9152EA0F430B,"This world have many energy and resources, but we have to something to conserve all of them. Some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, to try to conserve energy and resources, but they work ten hours each day that's mean that they still doing the same thing because they are working the same hours weekly. So I think this is not a good idea to conserve energy and resources, should my school follow this model by extending the school day two hours? I would say that my school should not follow this model because students would not have time to do things, students might miss a lot school, and is the same thing is like we come the five days to school.

We would not have time to our things because is going to be a long day two hours more, so we are going to be tired we might not want to do our homework. Somethings we have to do our personals things like help at home, or some other stuff that we need to do such as have fun with our family, or do what we like to do as play soccer, play video games, etc. I know that school is more important, but not the majority of the students thing like that. We would have to do all the things over the weekend, we might not spend time with our family because we would been doing homework, or some other stuff like personal things. Also some students only would go home to sleep because like I say we would be tired to much work at school. Even the teachers would not have time to plan what would be the assignment the next day, I know that they need time to plan in what we have to work on the next day, but they have to do things in their house as we the students too they also have homework to do after school. This is going to one problem that I think must happen if this school extend the school day two hours more.

We might miss a lot day of school because somethings we have appointments as go to the Doctor, or go to somewhere else also do some important things. some students might decide to not come to school because they have to go the appointment. As we know some students miss a lot school on this day if school extend the day they might miss more day of school because they might say that is too long the day, or if they have a project to do and is a big project (we get out until 5:00PM), so we have to finish in whole night supposing we finish the project until 3:00AM, in the morning we not going to wake up because we are tired, we would miss the day of the school also we would not turn it in the project (It was the only day that we would have to turn it in), so we didn't get the grade for the project. Also teachers would have problem with their children for example if they have their children in a day care id they only work until 5:00PM they have to run to get they children, but if there is traffic, so they would be late. They might have to paid extra money to someone can pick up their children. Even when we come for the five-days per eight hours we have more time to do our thing that we have to do after school.

Some people might say that they support to come to school to a four day school week and extend the day two hours because we would have three free days. However, is going to be the same if we come the five days per eight hours because we would come ten hours per day, so ten per four is equal to forty hours for day (this is if we come four-day a week), so eight per five is equal to forty hours (this is if we come the five days per eight hours). We would still using the energy and resources at the same amount as we use to do it now, as we see is the same thing if we come to school the five days per eight hour. We need something that help us to conserve energy and resources not something that would give the same amount the we are using now.

Finally, I think this is not a good idea to conserve energy and resources because we would use the same amount that we're using right now. My school should not follow this model because they have to think that consequences like people would miss a lot of school they might be tired too much work in one day of school to long one day, we would not have time to do our things at home like homework, personal things, and we would not have time to have fun by doing what we like to do as play soccer, or other stuff, and is going to be the same thing if we come to school the five days per eight hours. We have more time to do our homework, to do what we like to do like have fun, and spend time with our family when we come the five days per eight hours. If we really want to conserve energy and resources we have to find something that is going to be successful, not something that would give us the same result.          ",2.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.9,1

The first reason is when someone show their kindness to much and they get annoyed.

The second reason is when they show kindness back they will angry at you because you got annoyed bye theirs.

The third reason is some people just don't like small people because they believe they give you bad luck.

My forth reason is an ex:Like say someone like lets say...Generic_Name gives you a hug but lets say the player decides to kill Generic_Name then Generic_Name his brother comes and shields him then Generic_Name gets his revenge bye judging you by teaching you to be nice.

My last reasons] is also a ex:Then you spare/give him respect Generic_Name is happy and goes home you can chose to kill the king or go to his house and live with him and ask him to teach you the acts of kindness.

The other ways people can show kindness is fighting their demons.

And fighting bullies from their past in their head or in the real world.

Sometimes gas stations get rob and the police have to chase them down and sometimes you can help them.

Some other ways people and kids can help they can show kindness to the ocean bye getting trash in the water.

Another why people can show kindness is helping the community pick up trash on the ground.

People across the world their are so much kind people out their they can help you with anything.

Like clean up your yard and the shed and the playground and the trampling and the outside of the house.

And they need kindness to so we help them to in needed or in trouble.

2654,C465964DA6D5,"Do you think that you need to fail over and over to become success. In this essay, I will argue about the important role failure plays in people success. people that become success is because they have failure a lot of time during the process, and they work harder each time to do it better.

When someone success in something, they had failure in something one time in their career. Maybe the fail they took in their career is what make them successful. They knew, if they dont work harder they wouldn't do any better. A failure can teach you lessons to do better that last time. That why a lot of people said that never gave up just for a fail that you can have. Thats what make a person successful.

Failure is something that all of us do. Thats what make us do better in life. If we all ignore are failure, we would keep failing over and over. That why we have become successful in something in are life. For example, when I was 10 years old, i couldn't ride a bike. I away fail trying to ride it, but i never stop trying. I try doing different way to learn. My success of riding a bike was based on failure that teach me different way to learn something and better.

My dad have a company that he have work hard and a lot to archive what he have now. He never loss his enthusiasm to make his company better, years over years. All the knowledge that my dad have now is by the failure. Sometimes he have lost a lot of money, or work for free, because he din't do what the customer said. Some times was because the customer din't like the work.

Now he know that he should do the work as the customer said and do the work better. He have learn that he should do what his job more better and do what the customer said.

Some people said that you don't need a failure to become successful, but they are wrong. Success comes from failure that make you have knowledge. All the failued that you took make you work harder and do way better. In the future, I hope people learn more from their failure to be successful in what they want to archive in their life.

3851,FDC94E0FE9C8,"Have you ever did something because is on trend or just because someone else did?. As you must know humans are easily influenced by others way of thinking and acting and it is because we want other people to like us showing that humans are social individuals. The best way of influencing others is setting an example by ourselves because we tend to compare ourselves to other people, also humans repeat what they like like the fashion trends, and lastly, because social pressure can lead us to do things even if we don't want to just because everyone else did.

Everyone is influenced by what others thinks or do.

First, we have to begin with the way in which we usually compare ourselves to other people. Is common that if we see someone breaking the rules we'll claim that ""We are on our right to do it to"" . Or we can just see that this happens a lot between siblings; if one of the siblings gets something the other one will want the same. For example, when my parents buy something for my brother, I want them to buy something for me to. Or when they let my brother be out until a late hour, I'll claim that I have the right to do the same the next time I go out. People is always comparing themselves to others in what they have or don't have.

Next, is imperative to analyze the humans dependence in wearing what others wear just because is in trend. If for example Gigi Hadid wears sweat pants with heals and looks good, every girl in the world would run to buy the same clothes and wear them because now is a trend; or if a girl in my school wears makeup in some way and I liked how it looked, I'll copy the look and wear it some other day. Humans like parrots repeat what they like.

Finally, the social pressure can make us do things we don't want to just because someone else did. That is why many times we've heard "" If other people jumped from the bridge, Will you do it to?"". For example if we are on a party and someone offers a drink, the probability of drinking it is high because everyone else is doing it, and we want people to like us. If someone challenges us, we would do it because we want people to like us. Social pressure is an influence in what people do.

In conclusion, Setting an example on our own will help us a lot in making people do what we want them to do. A smile is contagious, kindness is contagious and humans as social individuals repeat what they like and humans want people to like them.",3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,1
2564,BE928441C9D6,"I agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. I believe Churchill about what he said ''success consists of going from failure without loss of enthusiasm ''

sometimes in life you have to be a failure to be successful. For example , I know friend of mind when he first came to the USA he didn't even try to speak English.

After a while the time came and he had to learn and try when he tried he filed and filed couples times in till he be came a successful . me in person filed couples times in all SOLS

but I had fix and I kept trying and trying in till pass all of them. at the same time it might be a bad thing because some of us when they fail they give up so easy.

I sagest we should teach student about what that success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.                                                                                             ",3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.7,1

When you have free time that's when you can text call but not in class because if you do then we won't know how to do the work and we would get a bad grade.

So when it's after school lunch or your free time you can use a phone but when your in class you need to turn it off because your teacher is trying to teach you something. When your in class every day you know something new about something, someone, somewhere.

2449,B5FFED1536FE,"I disagree with Emerson because if they have already mastered, and they still want to try something new, it's good for them, and they will grow up by the time they figures out what they want to know more.

While you already mastered, it doesn't means you known everything in life. Emerson wrote, ""Unless you try to do something..."" You should doing something more than what you have known. For example, ""You want to study more languages than other people and they keep telling you not to do it."" The reason they say it because they think if you good in one thing, you should only focus on that things and try to do as good as you can, but if you are a person who are interesting in many thing, you shouldn't listen to them. Keep follow what you are interesting and try to do it. If you want to know more than a languages or want to try to do something not your domain and you have no skill in that things, you should try to learn what you're interest, and try to talk to a person who is speak a language you are interesting, and asking a person who have known about the domain you are interesting, and try to do your best in that thing. If you're a person know one thing and only focus on that thing, sometimes it good because you are so good in that thing and you can help other people what you good, but it also not good because you don't know anything except your master degree. When you're interesting in many things, people can't despise you. If you try to do the domain it's not your skill just try as much as you can to study that, then ask for help to somebody good in that domain.

Eventhough if you are a person who don't have any interest in other thing, you're still good but keep in mind if you want to do something not in your master degree, it will be challenge you because you are not know anything about that domain. However, try something new beyond your mastered will help you, and it's good while you are a person have a lot of dream and you're keep follow your dream and don't listen you other people against what you are interest.

2573,BF267B42A2A4,"The humanity now in days had been not so good lately, there is many different opinions on how you should do things in life or how you should act. It is well informed that people can be complicated but nobody will said the life will be easy all the time. I think people should start making their own decision because, they can learn about life, have a better understanding on how life works and how to value their-self and be efficient person on their own.

However, there is a big chance that people can tell you how you really should live your life, you have to experienced it in persons there will be a day when you are going to fall or something can happen you are not aware on how life can be so hard and difficult in times. Also mistakes are allow nobody is perfect life will surprise you anytime without you notice it you got to be ready to face it not matter how easy or hard it could be. When you make your owns decision you will be capable of making the right decision for yourself.

Meanwhile, it is hard to understand life sometimes but is part of our daily life and you have to understand how it really works so the way you do not stress out for a simple thing, life gives you challenges that only you as the only responsible of yourself have to face it and all will depends how you take things it will be a result of it. As we grow life will make us stronger or weak it all depends but best choice of making the right thing is that you should be aware that anything can happen without given you a hint it will hit you on the right time or not on the best time you wanted it. Anything that will hurt you will make you strong and that's how you know that your are living life.

Lastly, people might not notice it but if we do not love ourselves nobody will do it, people do have to depend on some else to be happy it's all about you. In addition anything you do will not make others happy you have to learn to do everything on your own because that more efficient you are the more good things in life you will make. Be your own and value every single thing that is around, but remember nothing is easy life can surprise you anytime.

In conclusion, people should start making their own decisions to be aware of what life really is if your learned and have a better understanding about life in a daily routine anything that will happen will not surprise you. Loving yourself will make you love others. Hopefully people will take a note that life is all about you and not others each person has a different thoughts and ways of seen life.

2405,B2D03F892B0D,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home?

In my position I think it's a great idea to attend classes from home only if you work, or if you can handle any type of work by yourself without a person that will persuade you to do the work, and if you know English perfect.

I think that some students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Because for some students it's difficult to wake up early because some students who work on

Part-times, and some students don't want to wake up early, or they go to bed late for playing games on their phones.

Secondly. I think that some students might benefit from this program if they can handle any type of work independently without a teacher or any person persuading them to do the work, because some students are smart and they like to work independently, in silence, without people disturbing thems or without too much explanations.

Also. I think that the only students that can understand any work and can only attend classes from home, are those who knows English Perfect, because if you know English perfect then you can work in any topic or subject without the help of anybody, If you are a Hispanic born in other country then this program it can work for some Hispanic students because they are used to get everything easy, to get what they want without making a effort.

In the other hand, I think that this program it won't help to those students who distract easy or those who don't do work without any person who will persuade them to do the work, because there are students who likes everything easy, students who don't want to make an effort, this program it won't work to those students who don't like to study, to those who have only F on their classes or those who are skipping, or not going to school.

In conclusion I think this program can only help those students who can handle any kind of work without the help of any person. and for those students who have dreams, those who makes a effort to get what it can help thems in the future, for those that knows that life it's not easy, to those students that know that if you don't work for it you won't get what you want on life. those students who can handle any kind of work without the help of any person.",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.8,1

They might learn things that interested them. Although some students think this opportunities are useless, actually it opens a lot of doors at a young age to learn about the things they like. For some students this is a big privilege. Find out who they are.

A few of this students are not really insterested in this opportunities. They tend to think that is useless just because they don't have the program they are insterested in. Normally people get use to the things they like, and they don't want to learn new things. Sometimes is hard to see that learning about new things could give huge benefits.

Other students realize that it could be fun to learn about new things. If they are lucky enough they could find the career they like. When kids start to go to school teachers always ask them to think about what they want to be when they grow up. Almost everyone wants to be a policeman, a fireman, a teacher, or a doctor. When they grow up their way of thinking chances. Kids realize that there are a lot of other things that they could like. While others grow with the same mentality. Some of them make it happen, but some others change their mind in the way. It does not only happens when they are little. It could happen when they grow up, so they should give it a try to new things. It might be better than it looks.

Also, If they find the program they like and try it out they might find out if they truly like it. I had a friend, and he really loved psychology. He took the class this year because he thought it could be interesting. Midway through the year he found out that he is not so good at it. Although it was too late to back up he realized that psychology was not what he was looking for. Sometimes people believe they have what they want and that there is nothing that could stop it. They all should have a second plan in case plan A is not working so well. Everyone should be ready just incase there is a rush change, and they have to take a decision in less than a day. They have to hope the best and get ready for the worst.

Some students think this opportunity is lame for not having what they want to learn about. Some others see that there are a lot of benefits in it and go for it. I classify myself as the kind of student that takes new chances. I also have two careers in mind. I know if one of them fails me I still have the other one.

h y schools shouldn't allow students to have and use cell phones for educational purposes? Although some say that schools should allow students to have and use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes, actually they shouldn't because students most of the time will be using their cell phones just to be in social media and also students probably will try to use their cell phones to cheat.

Those who believe that schools should allow students to have and use cell phones in classroom for educational purpose they have their reasons. They believe that it will be more easy for students to complete assignments and also it will help students to turn in their work on time.

In my opinion I think that schools shouldn't allow students to have and use cell phones in classroom for educational purposes because students most of the time will be using their cell phones just to be in social media. I think that because when I am in my Algebra 2 class my teacher always assign us to complete some work that we have in blackboard,but what I noticed in the last month was that most of my classmates that were around me they weren't doing the assignment instead some of them were just playing video games,watching videos in YouTube and using Snapchat.

I think that schools shouldn't allow students to have and use cell phones in the classroom for educational purpose because students may use the cell phones to cheat. I believe that because such as a student if I was taking a test and I didn't study and I have the cell phone with me I will try to use it to find some answers in Google and also if students are allow to use the cell phones in the class they may use them to cheat by taking pictures of other student study guide,assignments and homework.

Most of the times I believe that people ask for multiple advice from multiple people because they want their adive to impact them in a certain way. However, sometimes one person cannot be convinced by one voice they like to hear multiple voices to be convinced. Most often people are not motivated by themselves which would make it harder for them to be motivated by a single voice because those people needs to hear multiple opinions to make them better or motivated. So let's say that this one person likes to change his or her life and become more motivated, be in the best shape of his or her life, so he or she ask about 10 people how to get motivated and how to work hard to achieve your dreams. Hearing motivating and powerful words from other people can impact your life without you even knowing.

He gets about the same advice from people as he did from the people before and as he heard all of those people talk about the same topic now he or she would be motivated because sometimes not only one voice but two would put a big impact on someone's life and help them. My teachers, friends, family, and all of the people I've met in my life had gave an advice that I heard and took their advice because it meant something to me and it was deep. I would want more people to give me advice that can impact my life, for example my friend's dad always gives him advises but he has hear his dad tell him the same advice over and over again at the end of the day he will get bored and not listen to his dad's advice which would impact him negatively.

Sometimes life gets hard to certain people and they would like to hear advice from multiple people which will impact them in a positive or a negative way depends on who they ask advice from. For example if I were to ask advice from my brother all the time he would just repeat everything he said from before and that would not help me at all, after all they say ""two brain is better than one.""

Listening to other people's advises can impact you in a way that would make you do the right thing in the future and not only it can impact you it can impact the people around you.

1597,79D634E4575F,"Some schools of the United States are looking forward to the day that students will attend classes from home by way of online. Dispite this exciment it can be not beneficial for some students in the way of learning. Making students to attend classes online happens will change many students lives. Although some say that offering online classes by the school would be more beneficial, actually it won't be beneficial for students who wants to attend online classes offered by the school because it will require more work for students and students will have less interaction with people face to face.

Those who believe schools should offer online classes have reasons. They believe that students will have flexible schudeles during the day. It will help students to relieve strees and to work if they have a part-time job. They also think that students will become more responsable attending classes from home. Doing their work in their own will develop a self- decipline.

One of the main reasons why schools of the United States shouldn't offered students to attend classes online from their is because it requires more work from the students. For example, my friend Generic_Name. He is attending one class online from his home. He says that he doesn't have too much time to practice a hobby or do something else because he needs to do a lot of assignments for his online class. Sometimes he has to do two homeworks each day just for one class. Also his class online requires to write a lot, such as essays or read books. Essays and reading books counts as a big percent of his grade. And it doesn't include the warm-ups and classworks during the class. Requiring this ammount of work schools shouln't offered these classes online because too much work is assigned just for one class. If students want to take other classes they won't have time to do it. Like my friend Generic_Name his life has become very busy since he stated taking this online class offered by his school.

In fact, students become very wird because they have less interaction with people face to face. For instance, my counsin Generic_Name she used to be a girl that really liked to interact with people. One day her school offered her some online classes to take. She said yes. Well in a short period of time her parents starting to notice that she was becoming a very shy and wird person when time was passing and continuing taking clases online. Later, her parents found out that her online clases made her become a wird child because of the less interaction she had with people. Schools should privide students a diferent method to help students to attend their classes becuase online classes keep students from the real world and their interaction with people. Avoiding classes online will reduce the percent of students to become wird and shy and to have a better relationship with people.

In conclusion, many schools of the United States should stop offering students online classes becuase it requires a lot of work for the students. These classes just make students's life busier than what they expected. Also, students are afraid to interact with other people face to face because they spend most of time in their computers. The real world need students who like to interact with people not shy students.

Reasons. (why is good)

becuase is good for you live because you have one year early and this can help you to do it a greet estudent and with this year early you can go to the college early or you can work one year and after this year you can star the college, and if your finis the high school in three year that mean you are a good estudent and thats can help you because you can find a programs that can help you, because if you want to go to the college the college is not chip and for follow your dream you have find a solucion and the solucion is give you best.

Example. Because if you find a programs that can help you, so you can follow what you want to do it in a future.

If you are a bad students and you GPA is so down you can`t go to the college becuase for going to college, I think you GPA have to do more the 3.00 for you can go a good callege.

Thats why I think is good take the high school in three year, because you can have more oportunidis for well have a good future.

Yes is good idea that students to finish high school in three years becuase is something like well better for you futuere, in your live.

Number one we finish the assignement alot faster. Number two everyone is working on something different. Number three everyone is helping each other if we struggling on something. There is the bad part about working in a group is that there is alot of distration, there is also different ideas that everyone wants to put in the assignment. Now lets look at the good part on woekinmg on the assignment alone. number one there is no distractions getting in between you working. Number two there is only your idea on how you want it to look like. Number three you can ask the teacher on how sheor he wants the assignment to be done, so that means that the assignment is going to be correctly done. The bad part on working alone is that there is going to take more time on the assignment to be done. the other part is that is that you have to do all the wrok by your self and have to rely on your self. Other words if you pick to work in a group or by your self, are going to be struugling kinda the same thing like how mush work you have to finish, the different ideas on how you wnat it to be looking linke or how you want it to be done.

In a group i can have one part on the assignment that i have to finish.

Summer break is the only long break that the school gave to the students to do all the things that they couldn't do during the school year and they can rest for a long preiod. I don't agree for these reasons:

First, A lot of students wants to work during the school year or do other things that take more time to do, but they can't do it because they got too much homework or they need to study for a tests that they have that week and they just had time for that. So in Summer break they got 3 months so they can work and do more things that they couldn't do during the school year. Students can work and have more experiences that can help them when they want to apply for another work that is much better for them and learn more things.

Next, Students needs a break after the school year. Most of the students get stressed for all the works and tests the teachers gave to them, their brains needs to relax and rest for a preiod time because it's not good to be always working, they got tired too. So Summer break is the best period to relax and distract for a period time. Students can go to the beach and have fun, Enjoy more time with their famillys, hang out with their friends, go visit new places, too much things they can do in this break and the weather is perfect too.

Finally, In Summer break the students don't worry about works or tests they may have need to present when the break is end. When they have Fall, Winter or Spring break the school gave to them just one week and in that week most of the teachers gave to the students works and tests they need to make after the week breaks, so in conclusion they don't have breaks because they need to study or do works that the school gave to the students. In Summer they don't need to worry about that and enjoy the time they got.

Some persons may don't agree with me because they think that have more breaks during the school year is better for students, but they need to know that the students got works during that breaks and they need to study for tests that they need to make after the week break, so in summary, they don't got that time to relax and give a time period to their brains so they can rest.

In conclusion, Summer break is the only long period that the students got to relax and they can do so many things that they couldn't do during the school year because of all the works they got and test that they need to study for. So Summer break needs to stay like that and is the best season for students so they can enjoy and have fun in their long break.",4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.3,1

The importance of decide what career the students want to take before they leave of the high school,

is to prevent to be confused when they enter to the University . For example , if the students take mechanic courses or courses about how to be a Doctor in High School , would help them to experiment what career they would like to take after High School .

If the students decide experiment to be a nurse or doctor , they will go to a Central Medic or Hospital and get information about that career , or they will go to a mechanic workshop to learn and get knowledge about how to be a mechanic .

Is a good idea for students think about a career to young age or try to be prepare for the future and take some courses of study in high school because if the teenagers try to found some career that can be agreeable for them and try to learn about it , it is a good form that they can be prepare in the future .

With the opportunity of learn in different courses in high school , will be more easy for the students to decide what specific career they like more and they want to learn and study after high school

In other hand , the specific courses in high school , would be selected by the students , because if they decide to take a course that they like , they will enjoy at the same time , and they will try to do the better they can

3530,F032D40816C0,"Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm I think is a good idea because, you can be a successful person, you need believe in yourself, and you need support of your family.

You can be a successful person, because you can do all the things that you have in mind, and you can realize more than you already have, for example once my friend Generic_Name told me that her cousin Generic_Name he loves fix computers, but he only can fix computers he can not fix telephones, TV, refrigerators and another electronics devices and he always was sad because his goal was that he can fix all the electronic devices, he join in a group of people that fix electronic devices, he always cry because he did not understand the things that he was learn, he always was try day to day, so one day he was the winner in the competition of who was the person that fixed one TV in the less time as possible, he fixed the TV in 1 minute, other people fixed in 10 or 5 minutes, finally he earn a diploma of the best fixed person, after 5 years he learn that nothing was impossible for him , in the actuality he has a store that he sell and fix electronic devices. The experience of Generic_Name is a good example in our life because he learn that never give up, he always fight for his goals and that example we can do exactly the same that Generic_Name always fight for our goals and always try another new things that we think that we can not do.

Also the reason that you need believe in yourself is that you always need be positive person, every day see what are the things that you need for have success or what you need to do every day. In my experience I was in 10th grade was my first day of school at Generic_School,I never was with a lot of nervous, and I did not speak English ,so all my classes in my first day of school I feel many eyes on my because I was the new student, then at the end of my day I take my correct bus and when I was at home talking with my mom I told her that I do not like the school because was different of my schools on my country and my mom told me that with the pass of the days I will feeling a good person, a correct person. So in my first year in the school I get all my classes with A at the end of my first year I earn one diploma in Math and four diplomas for each end of the quarter, so I pass 11th grade with excellent grades too, but sometimes I fail my classes my test in Algebra I fail many of the test or sometimes I get D or F in my classes and when I fail something is when I was think that I am not good in my classes or in English that was to hard learn the language English, all my teachers talk with me that I was a good student always complete my work, every day I was pay attention to my teachers, and then I pass to 12th grade this year is more difficult because I need pass all my classes, all my ESOL and other things for example my WISE test, and now my teachers, my counselor, my mom told me that I am a excellent person, and sometimes I think leave the school and start to work because I feel that I cannot go to the end of High School . This is my experience and I believe that sometimes I am wrong because loss enthusiasm it is not a good idea always I will have failure or another experiences that are not good.

And this is why we need believe in our self if you do not believe in your self you may be you do not complete all your goals or all that you have in mind.

Other people say that success consists of going from failure to failure and loss enthusiasm, but otherwise you need support of your family because the family is very important in your life and always you need a opinion from your family. For example one day my uncle

Generic_Name he was in his college George Mason his family was in Mexico he was the only person that was in Generic_City. He always try to do all of the way correct and always be a good student and a good person, but one day he fail a very important test in the college that test was the final test in his College, and if he fail this test he can not graduate from College and he was feel like a person that he can not do anything and he told to his friend Generic_Name that he did not pass the final test, but Generic_Name said to Generic_Name that he can not tell to Generic_Name's family because they may be feel sad for Generic_Name, so the option for Generic_Name was that he was need start one more time all the College or he can paid extra money for retake the final test, but was a lot of money, so he decided that he was taking one more time all the College, but he do not see for support of his family, finally Generic_Name told to Generic_Name's family what happens with Generic_Name and why he still do not graduate from College, and Generic_Name's family talk with Generic_Name and he tells the true and his family tell him that why he do not see for support in his family. This example is exactly the explain for why the support of your family is very important, the family is the first group of people that we need to tells them always the true and they will have a excellent opinion about what you asking them.

In conclusion, loss enthusiasm when you are failure it is not a good idea because can be a successful person, you need believe in yourself, and you need support of your family. And always think about what are the things that you are complete or for what you need this goals. Also, think about that if you failure you need keep going and never give up because if you feel that you can not do anything all your life may be your will think that you not are a good person in something that you have in mind. Finally think about all the good things have a successful person and how you can do like a successful person what you need to do or what materials you need for be a successful person.

If you are passioned, you will be better at everything that you do, also, we have to be passioned to look for new stuff that you will like to know more about and learn about it.

3070,DA86BC9B9FB6,"I think is a good choice for people to take classes online or at home because they can learn more and concentrate better and put more attention and nobody can distract them. I think if people do it online or at home they are not going to make friends. Sometimes is good to make friends because they can help you or be with you in someway is good to go school then taking at home or online. Also if they do it online or at home they are going to be more prepared and ready for wet ever situation because they was putting attention in their lessons. But being in a group in school is more interesting because you can meet new people and don't be alone doing the work but everything have their good choices for do it and people can decide how they want to do it or how much they want lo learn.

some people prefer to take classes from home or online. because they can be more concentrate without nobody distracting them. I think it will be a good choice for them to do it online. For example if they are doing work in a group they are talking and don't concentrated but if they are with nobody they can work better and do their work. This can be the reason for more people take that classes because they work better with out no one else. The people who studies online or at home are more intelligent, and learn more because they are concentrate in what they are doing. In sometimes in the schools they are not concentrate because they are playing or talking with their friends and that can distract people. If they make a competition an student who studied on line or at home with one student is a regular school I think the student is not on the school can win because sometimes that students are more prepared then the regular school. Also sometime the students who go to a regular school they just go for play with their friends is good to have some friends but they are not concentrate o they are sleeping when the teacher is explaining and then when they do the exam or quiz they fail. But if one student is studding online or at home they are listening for when they have to take the exams they can pass and are more responsible with that.

When the school is over at the end of the year some people learn a lot but some people no because they were just playing and don't putting attention or sleeping in class. But the people who studies online or at home they are ready know a lot because they were concentrated and no one was distracting them and that if how they work someones want to learn and pass and someones no each one can take their own decision. I think studies online is more better, more productive at the and of the year. Taking classes at home can benefit at the students in many ways and they know more at the end of the school. When the students at the regular school at the end of the year they have an SOL test. some students fail this test because they did not learn nothing for the rest of the year just for be sitting and doing nothing. But if someone who studies at home have the ability to pass the SOL because they were interested of the class of what were they learning and don't have distractions all year.

Generic_Name woke up every day early in the morning and he went at the college, after he took a bus for his job. After all his effort, after all the nights that he could not sleep, he became in a lawyer but Generic_Name never imagine that the real challenge is coming. After two years of his graduation he found a job ,he bought a house and a car and that is all Generic_Name did for the rest of his life. Should we aspire just at one thing? In every single aspect of our life we have aspiration, to be more every day to get the most beautiful house, the better job but that is all when we get all the we want and the set we stop there. In my opinion,if we don't try to do something beyond what we have already mastered,we'll never grow because we'll never have the enough experience and a better quality of life.

First,we'll never the enough experience because we always being in the same situation, every experience that we have make our knowledge,the way that we see the life and the problems. If we never give up to do something beyond our spirit preserve young while we have more experience we'll have more opportunities nos just in a professional aspect . For example,if we go to college and we finish the career but we stop there for the simple reason it is more safe so we never grow because that make us to be stagnate in one place,we think that doesn't matter that we good.

Second,We'll have a better quality of life because when we try to do the best every day,when we kept learning we became in a successful person which is good point because you inspire at others. we'll have all the thing that one day we wanted an the most important thing we'll have the power to help other. For example,when we continue learning more and more we'll stay one step more near of our challenge and we need continue to the same way.

In summarize,I'm agree with Emerson's statement because we always need to be more that we were yesterday.

2901,D1B607165DAB,"In the past, I was scared to go beyond at what I was good at which was soccer. I agree with what the quote which said, ""Unless you try something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" because if you stay at the limits that you were already at before you'll never know what other things you can accomplish and we as people have to acknowledge the fact that in one point in life you probably said to yourself

"" I am going to maintain this life."" by saying that your not improving your life.

I agree with what the quote said, ""Unless you try something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" if you stay at the limits that you were already at before you'll never know what other things you can accomplish. To begin with, you want to to go beyond standards because maybe you'll learn something new ,or you will encounter an ability that you probably thought you didn't have. For example, when I was in freshmen in high school I decided to start playing and training for soccer and I tried out for the junior varsity soccer team I told myself I am gong to play at my standards, so the coach saw me playing nervous and he asked me "" why are you playing nervous"" I said, "" I am trying to play at my standards"" the coach said, ""Just relax."" after that I found out I had so many abilities to become a great soccer player. In addition, it's not bad at all trying to go beyond your limits because the more you go beyond your limits the more you'll want to keep doing it. Also, there's that one saying "" Go Big Or Go Home"" one of the sayings I live up to. Finally, you always want to think big for the most part of your life. Also you always want to try new things in life that's the only way you'll grow in life.

I agree with what the quote said, ""Unless you try something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" we as people have to acknowledge the fact that in one point in life you probably said to yourself

"" I am going to maintain this life."" by saying that, your not improving your life. To begin with, life is short to be honest you and I am still trying to do things to improve my life. For example, I am 17 year old in highschool, I listen to with one song called ""the nights"" by Avici. He talks about his dad telling him you always want to experience new things and try to live life to the fullest, so right there I am just saying to myself don't maintain the same life, try to experience new things in life period. In addition, don't have a simple life try to be creative in this life. Also, you might not be ready to go beyond your limits, but just know that one day you might be willing to give it a try. Finally, there was one time I was scared to go on big roller coasters. I could only go on medium roller coaster because they didn't look scary at all, but there was moment on the day I told myself I getting a big roller coaster so I did and it made feel good about myself because I tried something new.

Also some people may say that, you will grow even though you don't try anything new in your life. In addition, some people probably don't even care about life. Finally, others might have their own opinions about this topic. Also some wouldn't really care about. In conclusion, in the future I will try to improve my limits and think big.                            ",2.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.3,1

First, Working with a group is more Benefit than working all alone, Because sharing answers helps me learn New thins to learn about new answers to thing about because I,m not that good in English speaking, For example i got Generic_Name, My English 11 Teacher Gives the hole class a paper to Read and answer, By the time i finish reading i ask my tracher if i could let Generic_Name to be my partner so we could help each other and get it done on time by helping each other and share our answer to see a diffrent thoughts of each one of us,

Secondley, Working with a group is more Benefit than working all alone, Because Its fun to work with a person or more, For example in History Class, when the teacher got to let us do class work for tomorrow exam or test, she let us do a group of 4 and do a challege in a computer so we could learn and do fun in the same time.

Because Students could finish their work on time, Foe Example Last week me and Generic_Name we got a project is Due in two day in History class, We worked together and reachers a diffrent thing and write a diffrents thought and even diffrent answers and we compond all of our answers and finish on time with diffrents thoughts.

Conclution, Some people may say Working with a group is more Benefit than working all alone, But Sometime i like to work a lone because i could think of my answers and question and even could get my own grade but sometimes when i work in a group when i try to work and care about my work but the rest of my grop does not care so if no body has worked then the hole group will get a zero even the person who worked.",3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.8,1
2056,9AFAE6562E98,"The purpose of always doing something helps us get different kinds of experiences, it helps us accomplishe what we are doing and gives a purpose to what we want to do in the future. Throughout life, the experiences that you get can help keep you motivated on what you should and shouldn't do as well. In comparsion, when you are inactive you aren't benefiting from anything and you are just not getting enough experience for what you want to do in the long run. This is a major factor on how well you live your life and how you want your life to be. I do suppoort that we accomplish more when we are always doing something and it helps contributes to how we all live our daily lives.

One factor why I believe that this contributes to our daily lives is that, it helps you get an education on something new or just a job that you are interested in. While, going to school and getting an education is a major rule in a human life; it is not for everyone and it all depends on how much effort you put in and if you are willing to put in the effort as well. In many different countries and cities, not all jobs require an education all you have to do is have experience in a certain area or part that makes you want to learn more. This helps decrease inactivity and upbulid activity while you are doing something like helping your community, feeding the homeless, giving advice to young kids. It all just depends on how well you put yourself out there and willing to make a committment about it as well.

A second factor why I believe you feel accomplished by doing something is that, it gives you a purpose in life and a feeling that won't be given again. From my experience of helping kids with their homework afterschool it has always given me always a good feeling and making me proud that I am helping the community. This helped me gain self-satification for myself and let me understand the importance of showing kids at a young age how to be accomplished when you put the energy and time too. Another example I ever felt when doing somethingis when I play lacrosse , and how everytime I don't make my mile time I strive to do better for myself. Lacrosse has helped me put in an understanding on how self-satisfication doesn't come easy it takes time and effort. This benefitted me get motivated for what I should do more and always helping me understand that if I put in my time and energy then there won't be a problem on feeling accomplished. Doing something you love and getting that satisfication helps you serve purpose and feel more accomplished for yourself as well.

One last example of how always staying active can help influence your accomplishment is that you are acknowledging that you are given a purpose to uphold. I do feel like many people don't seriously take the opportunites given and it is very hard to undertake as well. I would certainly always feel accomplished when doing something that can help let others know I care and not just for my own image. I agree that many different factors can influence decision making but also making others understand how important you are to someone as well.

In conclusion, the more work you put in ;the more you are in feeling accomplished and in pleasing yourself as well. This can help give you a self-esteem boost for yourself and let others know that you are willing to put in dedication for yourself. Many people that I have talked to said that they have always felt like their ciommunity helps them grow and feel like they should give something back as well. Doing something remotely even small can benefit anyone's day in comparsion in doing nothing. Working for what you need to do is different for working for what you want to do and this helps you understand the need for self -satisfication and social-satisfication.

What does he mean by "" A problem is a chance for you to do your best.""? A problem is a mistake you did, and doing your best is improving form your mistakes. Some people learn from their mistake, and others don't. People who do learn from their mistake can help others and their self.

I do agree that problems is a chance for all of us to do are best. Their some people who don't really care if it happens again. We should all care about our mistakes because if we didn't care our mistakes would happen again , and if that mistake was bad, then you should care.

I made lots of mistake like failing a grade because i didn't care about school , but then i change and stared to be more motivated and now that helps me work hard to get my dream job. One of my other mistake is my anger. I would always get angry but I always try to clam down because I would always take it out on people, but it won't hurt to try to learn form your mistakes.

2434,B4CBDAF1161C,"Although some people say that classes such of art, music, and drama should be electives because you let students think on themselves, actually some say that students must be required to take drama, art, and music classes because regarding to this classes students can earn a lot of experience in this area and in a short future they will be contributing to the culture of the nation.

Often people comment about the classes that students are taking on school. They are agree that art, music, and drama should be electives because you let students think on themselves. As every person in this country we must let them take part of their own decisions. Let me remain you, when you were young there is a bunch of classes that you didn't like to take, you complaint a lot. It's the same with this classes. Students must decide what they want to do in order of their own benefit. Many students don't even care about those class and their grades look affected because schools required them to take those classes.

People suggest that students must be required to take drama, art, and music classes because regarding to this classes students can earn a lot of experience in this area. For instance we are in at school!. we are connected to other schools we can make events and build good relations between students in order to let them gain experience. as soccer, basketball, baseball, and football also we can create competitions to motivate them. the kingdom university during 3 years asked to 100000 people "" How do they feel about competitions""

and the 90% of people said, competitions motivate you, is not matter what kind of competitions the human nature always wants to win. In other to this some schools are more likely to invest money on those areas.

Culture is a good reason why students should be required to take art, music, and dramas classes. When we talk about culture we have to do mention that it does a huge contribution in the society. for example Tourism, some research showed that the 70% of people who travel to another countries just to know how their culture works. like in years before the music had been changing. The United States of America have long history in music like Jazz, Rock, Heavy Metal and so on. That's why music classes should be required for students to maintain the culture of music in our country. When we talk about art everyone has heard about the famous Leonardo da Vinci and his picture of the Mona Lisa. Outside there is good amount of artist who became famous because they impressed the world with fantastic pictures. drama, our world is a age where we use the social media for many reasons and social media need authors. Example Hollywood every year produce movies. All those authors have a really good home, cars, and many facilities to live. That's why students must be required to take drama classes because many of them can have the opportunity to enjoy a life like this.

Some say classes as art, music and drama should be electives for students because the own decision is important but classes such art, music and drama must be required because it give the students the opportunity to gain experience in those areas and contribute to the culture of our society and nation.

604,2DAA07621328,"Technology is taking the must attention than the comunicacion with other peolpe. Technology allows to complete many task without having contact with other people. Algouth, people say that technology is the future of our lives. Nevertheless I think people have the reason and this bring negatives effects on people's lives, the technology is taking our comunication with other person but its true we are going foward so each day the technology its growing in to our daily lives. In this present people can check out any book they want to read, shop, and play video games without speaking with other to another person.

In the past the people could come in the librery search for a book that the person wanted to read or ask to one of the employes from the librery for help to find a book and then that person will take a seat and spend the time he want to spend in the librery reading that book, that person comunicated with someone but now in this present people don't talk to any one because of the technology. In this present you don't have to move to anywhere to read a book you can do it from your house seating in your sofa just with one clic with the computer. The technoly helop us im many ways but depends and how you are usining. I used to go to the librery and read many books but like I said before now I just read a book in my room from my tablet and I did not need to speak with any person.

Go to the shopping store and buy thing for the bathrooom, livingroom, garden, and the garage was funy in the past because you were talk with people at the store during you were serch for some items. technoly change the way how to shop because you can use your computer to shop in online even if you don't have a computer you can do it from your phone the technology change our live in many ways. Technology is taking our laughs,smile,and the opportunity to met some friend. I used to buy some food at Chipotle restaurant and I laugh when I see my working at Chipotle and that is how should have to be, not how I do now, I just use my phone to order food from the app Uber Eats and they bring my food to my door and that it.

Have fun with friends in the school,strets,and the parks it chagend thanks to the technology. This reason why technology it changed our way how to live makes me feel sad, childs in the past used to have fun with anything because technology not was to big. but that changed when parents started to buy a cell phone for thir kid thta was the most error they could do because kids doesn't have the must intelligent brain to reconize how long they spend their time in the cell phones, technology took the childhood of our kid. when I was a kid like 10 year old I used to play with my friends after school in the floor with littler cars and we inmagent that we are like pilot of faters cars it was so funy. I think our kind have to enjoy their live having fun, not spend the time with the cell phones playing games.

To conclud I thing it has limitation of human cantact due to the use of technology had negative effects on people's lives. Those negative effect could destroy our lives for just use the technoly every single minute. the comunication with others its over because the technology is taking the must time of our lives. True technology is the future of the world but keep it in main how you can use the technology and the technology don't use you.         ",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.2,1

I needed help so i asked a friend. They told me some advices but i was still confused so i decide to ask another friend. If the advices were not helping out so much then i would just ask the teacher and the teacher should give you a lot of helpful advices because there the ones that are teaching the class so they should know what to do to help a student out.

Also the reason why people ask multiple persons for advice is because. if you ask one person for advice that person may not give you a lot of advices than asking multiple people for advices because the advices that other people are giving you can help you out more than that one advice that the one person gave you.

Asking multiple people for advice can teach you new things that you didnt know of. Asking multiple people for advice can help you in so many ways. Asking multiple people for advice make you help someone one day that needs advices in problems.

I feel like asking multiple people for advice can be important to you in so many ways like doing your homework, doing school work, driving a car, taking care of a baby, and so many other stuff that could help you in life for asking multiple people for advices.

Is good to be positive on the bad times, that way you do not feel worse. If you have a positive attitud, some people that have negative attitude is going to try to make you change, do not let that happend. be positive can make you a better person.

If you are going through bad times is always good to be and think positive, if you are a negative person you are going to see only the bad things of the good things, you can lose friends or you're family members, if you are a negative person, no body is going to like to be next to you.

negative people is going to try to make you change; some people can be selfish and if you always think positive and most of the times you regreat positive things, they are going to want to have what you have even though that you work hard for if.

3099,DBC60BDBC49E,The school board shouldn't add one and half hours to school each day. To begin one reason i think they shouldn't is that a lot of kids who play sports or clubs after school might not be able to because they don't have time to learn about how life is and how difficult it is and people's life difficulties. One example is that some kids play videos and since they dont have lots of time out side of school they might just play video game instead of sports and if you give them more time out of school more opportunities students will have. secondly Students will be more tired and less focus because if students have more time in school the more earlier they will have to sleep and most students don't fall asleep early also students have homework since they well most likely be tired from school they might take a nap and there might either wake up to late to do homework or not have time to finish all there homework. Thirdly more students will not want to be in school and may drop out from either too much stress or they just don't want to be in school because the longer time there in school the more tired they are and less time they have to do what makes them feel relaxed or not have time to do what they love to do. students also might not have time to make friends because there focusing on school and it might ruin there social skill and conversation with strangers out side of school. Lastly less amount of time they have to spend with there families because they would have to go to school for extra time and as soon as they get home they have to do homework and honestly by the time there done there going to be most likely tired to do anything beside resting or sleeping. Also some students have younger siblings to take care of after school so that would put more stress on a student and either a family would have to pay for a baby sitter or some families don't have money to pay for one so parents might take there student out of school just to take care of there sibling and so the extra time in school wouldn't help him.

A city council is debating adoption of a 10P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight curfew for teenagers. Dear city council I find it amazing that you are doing this but I also do disagree mainly because. For example, we teenagers have to some activities after school or we have jobs and if its not because of those things its because were stuck in traffic. I do understand the reasoning of why we shouldnt be driving at these hours of the night It's mainly because we're exhausted at that point we can't focus that much. To say something we teenagers we can stay awake much more longer than you adults why do you think we stay up for so long its not because we're bored no its because we want you to see that we can hold our own wait and we stay up for our jobs and dont sleep until we go home when we get home because in truth we can hold ourselves now.

Dear to the city council I actually do think we should have teenagers off the road before 12AM. For example, thats when people that are under the influence are mainly on the road and depending on where you are there could be deer. There are lots of dangerous things in the night that no one can see or even some dangerous people that might harm us in the night. There are a lot of bad things on the road at night and you as the driver could of course from your long drive an turn tired and maybe crash.

They will be mad at the school because the school will and late and don't have time to do anything because is we get out late of the school and the time that we get home are's parent wont let us have fun and they will send us to bed.

That is why the people won't like a extra hour of school because we are not going to gave fun and we wont be able to do anything about sport.

So that is why we dont what to have extra time of school because it can be boring because we only do homework and we don't go a out side we don't like extra time in the school.",3.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.5,3.0,2.6,1
1529,75AA6229A116,"i strongly agree when the Former British Minister Winston Churchill say how failure takes a extremely important position in success. To success you have to fail many times as you need to the same thing so you can get it right and success on in. Success is the desire of outcome in many goals in life, is the gaining of wealth and fame,

Success is to attain desire of doing what you like even know you are going to have to fail on it many times doing in it.

Success consists of going from failure to failure because nothing is perfect in life. During life you are always going to have ups and downs everyday, you are going to lose people because you might be doing something that they don't like or maybe You might be facing some obstacles that stops you from success and doing what you like. During success you are going to lose your enthusiasm in what you are trying to success in. You are going to start thinking i can't do this because i have done it many times and i always fail on it or i can't do this because my friend's and family members say i can't do it because when i do it i always comes up wrong.

Failure consists in falling to do something,it consists in the inability to do something or perform To success you are always going to fail and fail and fail till you get it right. you are going to face many difficulties doing what you like or the choices that you make but in the end there is going to be a purpose for what you are doing. You are not going to success on something right away when you know is the first time you are doing it ,

you have to take steps by steps to do it. there are so many things that are going to be wrong, they are going to be times that you are going to fail on what you are doing. there are going to be times where people are going to try to put you down and tell you that you can't do it just because its your first time trying it and you fail it in your first time. And your enthusiasm is going to come down and down each day for everything that people tell you. but you have to always keep your enthusiasm up.

Because enthusiasm consists in strong and a warm feeling that tells you that you re always have to keep strong and keep your head up in what you are doing.

""success consists of going from a failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm""is one of the Quotes you always have to keep on mind when you are doing something the first time. Ia the quote that you have too keep on mind when people tells you that you cant do anything because you fail it your first time. is the quote you have to keep on mind when you fail the first time and the the second time you got it right. thats where you are going to known the meaning of the quote. and you are going to see that all hard work you have done it was for a purpose to success more in life. maybe you might lost people during that battle but when you know the meaning of the quote and you understand it you are going to know that everything was for a purpose in life and after all you when through you success a lot in your life.

Every single person in this world make mistakes that means to me that no one in this world is perfect, but we need to learn that is part of learn in life, is something about to be better every day and the enthusiasm is part of learn about our mistakes. It is important to fall down and don't loose our hope because that hope and the enthusiasm make us better persons and that is our impulse to succeed and make our dreams real. We need to think like a winners no matter what is going wrong in our life, take our weakness and make it strengths. My mother once told me because you loose one battle that doesn't mean that you loose the war, that show the importance to don't give me up at any bad circumstance or bad decision that i took before in my life because no one in this life born with all knowledge or born perfect to don't make something wrong. She also show that i have to do my best, to give my hundred percent at whatever that i want do because that is what make us better persons, she show me that don't give me up, be dedicated and passionate in all that i want to reach.

Failure plays a important role in succeed because that is how the apprenticeship start at, what if all scientist they were gave up in their experiments just because they did something wrong in their experiments we probably would didn't have medicines or the cure to a lot of illness or all technology that we have in the actuality or the first people that worked for the NASA with their first rockets that they made it, they get on fire and burned up but they still tried out again until they reach they dream to be the first persons to go to the moon, all they learned from they mistakes, that was the key of their achievements, that is what made us humans learn from our errors.

Is important for us to fail but is more important to don't give us up, to follow our dreams and believe in our self in our own capacity that we are able to be better in whaterver adversity and solve all problems that life impose in our way that is the key to achieve all dreams that we have, not all in this life is perfect but with effort and enthusiasm we can choose the right way to go and found solutions to our problems no matter the adversity just trust your self and do be afraid to be wrong because failure what inspire us to be better and succeed and learn from our mistakes.",3.0,2.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.8,1

Even it's a great way to help you with school like homework, studying and learning also it makes teachers life easier. And I think people would get lost around the world if teachnologly wasn't made. Because GPS helps you to get to your destenation safely also it tells you where you at. Teachnologly is probably the best thing people will carry around them because all your messages, calls and emails comes threw your phone. When I got my first video game, I started playing it 24/7 because I use to play it with my friends during summer break. But one day I knew video games wasn't going to be a big thing anymore so I asked my parents if I could get a phone and they said "" yes I will buy it to you if you bring me good grades the next marking period"". When I got my first phone I started using it to text friends and being in soical media and I know that wasn't going to get me anywhere in life. But one day I thought to myself what if technologly can help you with everything like now adays? Because my computer helps me with homeworks and projects and I can turn it in on time.

Although, some people think technologly is bad because it keeps you out from playing sports, going out with your friends and communicating with people!

Some people don't buy their childrens a phone because they want them to work for it, but some parents aren't like that. People be going on soical media putting there own life at risk, that's why some parents don't let their own child have technologly. Also because people be using it all the time and they don't care whats happens around them. Like my parents didn't want me to have technologly when I was little because he wanted me to open to the world. But I was shy to talk to new people that I didn't even know, I started to be helpful and friendly to everyone because I knew some people didn't have the samething as me. Because some countries are really poor and they don't have money to eat and they can't help out their children with their eduaction.

In fact, I think technologly is always going to be helpful where ever you go, because if you go somewhere that people don't speak your language you'll have your phone on you and you can research there language and it will tell you. I really will not know if technologly was not made because it helps everyone in the world right now. It helps me pay my payments and learn online. So I think technologly is a good way to help you with things and to communicate with people that don't live with you.       ",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.1,1
108,07F3241EB3C6,""" How would pairing older students with younger students in school be helpful for both older and younger students?""

When I was in elementary school in Zambia I skipped 4th grade and went in 5th grade and it was challenging for me to keep up with the work in 5th grade. I was used to doing the same work as the other 4th graders in my school however things changed when I skipped 4th grade to 5th grade. When I got in 5th grade I started doing harder work than I did in 4th grade, I started getting lower grades than I did in 4th grade. When I was in 5th grade (where there were older people than me) I had to work hard to be at the same level as the other 5th graders. This was like taking college classes in high school. Pairing older students with younger students in school will help both the older and younger students because the younger students will be able to learn from the older students, the older students will learn how be good examples for the younger students, and the older students will encourage the younger students to keep learning and become good examples when they grow up.

When younger students are paired with older students, the younger students will be able to learn from the older students. Generally speaking kids are most likely to follow what older people are doing. In this case if older students are paired with younger students the younger students will learn good manners from the older students. Younger students will learn many things from the older students such as: good behavior, hard work, kindness, and etc... When I'm sitting around elder at home I learn a lot about different countries and cultures in the world. For instance, when the elders are talking about what is happening in Congo - a country in Africa - I learn about the economy in Congo and its government. It is just like learning in my Civics class at school. This is beneficial for me because I get learn and share about is going in some other places with my Civics teacher.

When older students are paired with younger student, the older students will learn how to be good examples for the younger students. Being a good example for younger kids is best for what the will do and be in the future hence, it is why my parents tell me to be the good example for my younger my younger brothers by being well behaved and respectful so that my younger bothers will learn from my behavior. My AVID teacher told me that when his son was young he taught him that boots were bananas and bananas were boots therefor his son knew that boot were bananas and bananas were boots. According to what AVID teacher told me in the pasted sentence it shows that kids do what elders do. It is really important for older people to be good examples for the younger ones.

When older students are paired with younger students, the older students will encourage the younger students to keep learn in school and become good examples when they grow up. Additionally when older students are paired with younger students it will encourage the your students to work hard and on the same level as the older students. I have a friend who skipped 7th grade at my school. When I asked her how she was doing in 8th grade, she said at first it was really hard for her to maintain her grades. But she encouraged herself to work hard and get good grades. She had to study every night and on the other hand she had work to do at home. It became challenging for her to keep up with both school work and work she did at home. Ultimately from all her hard work she got a scholarship for college while in middle school.

Pairing older kids with younger kids in school is helpful for both the older students and the younger students because the younger students will be able to learn from the older students, the older students will learn how to be good examples for the younger students, and the older students will encourage the younger students to keep learning in school and become good examples for others when they grow up. How would your life be like being in a place where there are no elderly people to learn from? We should always be good examples for younger people so that they can learn from us.

2748,CA290993DFBA,"Many students and teachers think that taking online classes are bad for the students and the school. The reason is that the students might not take any notes on what the teacher is saying. The other reason is that students will often get distracted from the lecture the teacher is giving to them. Students cannot be benefited of taking online classes because students might not take notes and that the students might not pay attention to the teacher.

Students might not take notes while being on a class that is online. For example, at school, students take notes because they are being watched by the teacher, so why would they do it if they are not being watched by the teacher; the students would not care about the notes. If the teacher is on the screen, but cannot see if the student is taking notes; most likely there are not because the students won't worry that the teacher could check them. Students should take notes when they get information about a topic, so that topic could stay in the mind of the student if they write it and they also try understand the topic from the notes. Teacher's won't even know there students are taking notes because it's online they cannot see them. also the students might not be paying attention.

The students might not pay any attention to the lecture the teacher is giving to them. For example, when a student looks around the classroom, but not at the teacher, they will miss valuable information that is needed, so it's like the same when it comes to online classes; information will be missed by the students. Missing information when distracted is terrible because students might miss out on what is going on in the class, might miss on something on they have to do, and miss on how to do there work. Students should pay attention; no one likes to miss any key information; therefore, students need to look at the teacher to get more information as needed to do an assignment. When students don't take notes, they will not only miss out on some key information, but might panic on how to do a problem on the assignment they were given.

The students cannot benefit from taking online classes because the students might not write valuable information in there notes and they might not pay attention to lecture that teacher is giving to them. The students won't take any notes because no one is watching them take the notes as the teacher goes on lecturing. The students could miss valuable information because they are not paying attention to the teacher, and the students might miss on how to do something in a assignment. From not taking notes to note paying attention is the reason why there cannot be students taking online classes because teachers might not know what the students are doing and students might not even care about all of this.",3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,1
2270,A9DA6C8A9555,"Albert Einstein said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge.""

I do agree because in your imagination you can think or do anyting you want. Knowledge is just using ur brain but it's not the same as imagination. Many people might agree with me because its just true. You can think of many ways; Therefore, all the things you think can come true but not all the time. Im going to tell you all the reason why!

Imagination is a whole new world, not many people can say that. You can create anything just by using ur brain.

In your mind think of scary movie, funny movie, and horror thing that can scare you. Sometime you can make up a plan by using ur imagination; Meanwhile, you can use ur Imagination for homework or any problem that you have at home. Think about it, you are goiign to love it.

Albert Einstein is one of the smartest people if you don't belive me read an article about him trust me. If you use your knowledge what the fun on that you can't even create nothing. Some people just say, use your knowledge for a problem instead of your imagination. knowledge is important but using your imagination is more important.

If you don't belive me belive Albert Einstien!

What would you like to use more your knowldge or your Imagination. Well think of the fun thing you can do with your Imagination. Well Albert Einstein would not have said, using your imagination is more important then knowledge. This is my opiaion but it could be your opiaion to. You need to try it, Im telling you it's so fun.

Imagination is really fun and helpfull in life; However not many people think that, Imagination fun because they never try it. Many people might think it boring and that there no point to it. But there wrong becuase how do you think that many people got out of there bubble or problem they had in school or home. Just use your imagination It might even help you in life or anywhere.

1481,72732FD01203,"""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"".

In my opinion, I agree with this quote because, if you do not try to do better everyday, you are not going to reach your purpose. When you have the experience, on doing something you have to keep doing it, and you will improve each day. If you keep working on something that you have already work on it, and you don't stop focused on, it will make you grow. The more things you learn the more prepared you will be in your life.

My first reason that support my response, is that if you don't keep trying to do better everyday, you are not going to complete your goal. If you keep trying your best and doing what you like to do you will grow each day. Its important that you try your best everyday not only you will grow in your life but you are going to make yourself proud as well. For example, some people have their goals but they don't try their best.

My second reason that support my response is that when you have the experience on doing something you most keep doing it, and you will improve each day. Every time you try to improve, its a good opportunity for you to grow. The experience you have will make your future better. If you work on something that you have already work on it, and you don't stop focused on it will make your life easier. The more you work on something the fastest you will see the different in your life. For example, in my experience every time I know how to do something and I keep practicing, on it I get to improve myself.

My third reason that support my response is that the more things you learn the more prepared your will be in your life. If you try to learn more things and not just stay focused in just one thing will make you to be able to grow. Everyday you most have the purpose of learning new things. Learning new things each day, makes a person specialized and all the things you know. For example, in my experience when I try to learn more about something, its easier for me to talk about it.

To conclude, I agree with the author Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement. The more you know about something, the best future you will have. If you focused on doing good everyday you will grow. Trying to do something you have experience with will make you grow. Working on your purpose will make you have a better life.",4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.4,1

Some school districts are thinking is this wonderful ides to offer a programs to the students that they can graduate in 3-years, the school districts should be approve the idea to graduate in 3-years because it will be so helpful to the students to feel more motivate to graduate early, the students will use the other year to work and make money to pay some par of their career, and the students can enter and start college one year early .

The students will feel more motivate to graduate early becasue many students that come from middle school they really took class of high school like Algebra 1, Geometry, Earth Science, History 1 ect, they can easely graduate and 3-years. I have two brothers older than I my brother that is 20-years-old he graduate in 3-years he miss only one class, but he take during summers because the school have the programs to high school students graduate in 3-years.

Also some school districts don't offer this program to graduate in 3-years and the students lose their motivation to graduate and who want to go to school just for one class a whole year, what happed if a student miss only one class to graduate in 3 year,but the school districts don't have the programs and the student have to come for a whole year just for want class like my older brother that is 29-years-old he only miss one class to graduate in 3-years but the school from California did not have the programs to leave him graduate in 3-years it was so bad for him and a lot of students past the same thing.

The student will able to use the other year to work and make money to pay a part of their career, we know that a lot of students don't have parents that can pay for their career because is a lot of money that they have to pay for a career, this year off will be so fundamental to the students who don't have the help enough to pay their career. During this year they can work and make money and have the opportunity to enter a college and be some one in life.

The students who are a school don't have the time enough to get a work outside and pay their career through a work. This is why a lot of students who graduate from high school don't take a career because they don't have the money to pay it, or their parents don't have money to help them, I have a lot of friends and family who finished high school but they did not take a career because they did not have the money enough to pay it, and what happed if you want to take a career, but you don't have the money enough to take it.

In some cases occur that when the student finish they high school in 3-years they start college one year early, or they start to work to make the money for it, they can finish their career more younger , we know that some career take like 6 or 8 years it will be so long , but have finish high school one year early will be so helpful for the students life.

Some students feel weary when they are taking 4-years of high school, they don't even have time to think about what they want to be, which career they want to take. The students don't have the time enough and this is why some students take wrong career and is very harmful for their life.

In conclusion, all school districts should be allow to offer the programs that high school students can graduate in 3-years, some school districts want the traditional four years, they think that is so helpful for the students, but they are wrong because the traditional four years cause a graduate decrease and many students go to school just for one or two classes, in the future if all school districts approve the programs to students can graduate in 3-years. Many students will be taking their career in college some one starting one year early, and other making the money during the year off to pay their career.

They say that example is not the main thing in fluencing others becuase being a example can be stressfull. For example, they can be stressfull on trying to do everything perfect to do not do wrong things to influence others and they have to be responsible with what they do to not do mistakes so that they can influences others and they feel that it is a very stressfull responsability of influcing others.

However, they believe that setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence others people and being a good example makes they feel responsible to others and they feel that they have the responsability to do the right way in their own so that they can be a good example to others.

In reality, they say that setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence others people because they feel that they have the responsibility with their own behavior so they can do the right way in their own first to influence others. They also say the having respect to others is a good example of our behaviors and being humildity is also a nice examples that we can teach or influenes to others. They believed that being honest with anyone is also a good example of our behaviors. For example, they believe that being responsible with their own behavior is a good example to start doing the right way and to influence others because the responsability gives to others respect. They say the being on time in any meeting makes they responsible with their own behavior and gives other a good example of responsability. They say that responsability is a example of our own behavior and can be something that they can learn with the time and needs practice. I believe that being honest with others is a good example by start setting our own example behaviors. I also believe that humildity is a good example of our behavior because the humildity and that responsability is something that I can learn from others with their own actions or their behaviors. For example, I learned how to be responsible with my things for my mom and my dad because they teaches me how to do it and that this need practice too and I also they teaches me that being a example with our own behavior makes you humildity and teaches you how to valore what you already has and accept what

I don't have.

In conclusion, they want to argue that setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence other people because being a good example by your own behavior teaches they how to do the things rights, so they can influence others by doing and taking the right way and also teach how to be responsible, honest, and being respect to others.",3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.5,2.8,1

Will I believe, that inactivity always serve a purpose because in order to finish what your doing, you have to take breaks between them and your body won't shut down while your doing it. Although, some people may say we accomplish more if we are on it all the time.

Inactivity always serve a purpose because in order to finish what your doing, you have to take breaks between them. To begin with, that's why now in days we have Saturdays and Sundays off. For example, our bodies wouldn't be able to function without any stopping point. Next, we're not even going to be able to sleep with all that pressure building up on us. Lastly, even animals take rest after along day of hard work to continue on moving.

Inactivity always serve a purpose, because your body won't shut down while your doing it. For starters, we can be working, but we might be falling asleep at the same time anything can happen. However, we might even get hurt doing work hours depending on what your job is. To finish off with, we can lose our lives while driving or cost others.

some may say we accomplish more if we are on it all the time, because we can get more work done and we can finish faster. First, we can learn something faster if we are on it all day nonstop without rest. Second, if we are on just on that we make better results of ourselves doing what we are doing. For example, if we are building an apartment or house you name it. We might just finish faster without a stopping point. It'll just take less time to get there, Just as a journey that takes you wherever you go without stopping. lastly, is great when you don't stop moving forward and accomplish your goals your'll make it.

It has been said that people who have a great attitude have more opportunity to sucess in life than people who have a negative attitude. However, some people may think that a good attitude is not always necessary because there are job that doesn't required a positive attitude. Having a good attitude can help you to find a job, make new friends and help you to archieve your goals.

For example, it can help you to find a job and if your job required to comunicate with others people your attitude will make people to like you, also your manager will like how you work and how you treat the costumers. Furthermore, your attitude can make you the best employer in your job and help you to find a better job.

In addition, a good attitude can make you find new friends and they will always want to talk to you or be all the time with you even if they don't feel good they know you can make them happy because you have a positive attitude that they like. More over, you could only have friends that have a great attitude like yours because people that have a negative attitude would not like to have you as a friend because you are always happy.

To archieve your goals you may need to have a good attitude because when you don't feel good and you don't want to continue trying your attitude will help you to never give up and continue trying until you archieve your goals. When I don't want to continue in high school and I just want to get a job I like to have a good attitude and think about my goals and how far I'm right now and that help me to make me happy and to not give up.

In other words, your attitude is really important in your life not everyone has a good attitude and not everyone think that attitude is important, but a great attitude can help you with many things like to make good decisions, to be a better person, and to make people love you.

Also In groups you can discuse and interact with your peers. Groups can also help one another and give eachother feed back depending on what your working one.

Another benefit working within a group is being able to have multiple ideas, thoughts rather than just you having to think and work on everything by yourself. This is the best thing there is to working in a group is that all of you have ideas weather there the same or diffrent,groups can combine eachothers thoughts and ideas to make somthing incredible.

Weather its working in a group project at school or your partisipating in a high end business group its all set to say that working in a group is way benificial than working alone.                        ",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.2,1
3755,F99B20789DD7,"Dear Schoolboard,

I think that school should not be extended. students need to have a long break at home because they might have after school clubs to attend to.

I think students should not have extended school because they are not going to pay attention to the teacher they need to rest their brains for a long time since you are in school for 7 hours. Another reason why i think students should not have extra time at school is because kids have to wake up early and they are tired so they wont pay attention since they dont get enough sleep.

The other reason why i think school should not be extended is because the students most of them do not pay attention so typically the teacher is wasting her time trying to teach them. Also why i think they should not extend school is because if the day is longer they are going to need more breaks during the day and it takes a little long to go back in the building.

On the other hand i think they should have a extended school because they will know their subjects faster and that will make the school year faster. Another reason why i think they should extend school is because the students are really bored at home and they wish to learn instead of being home board. The last reason why

I think school should be extended is because kids might not pay attention during the day so with the extra hour they might want to pay attention and they will learn a little.

The last reason why i think school should be extended is because the students do things outside of home that are not good for them like doing challenges,steeling or getting into fights outside of school which can cause them injuries. The other reason i think they should extend school is because students would or will have a better education so that when they are grownups they will find a job that pays you more than the others.

These are the reasons why i think students should and should not have school extended i think they should extend school for a better education and i think they should not extend school because it is way too long",4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.2,1

2583,BFB07811C92D,"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Some people think that they can control there first impressions at any time that they wanted to, but thats is not right, first impressions are so fast that it does not let you think, or express in a different way they are faster them a second, there are impressions that can be change, but it depends in the situation that you are in, and other can not be change no matter what you do. I agree with this statement, because impressions are an affect, feeling or image retained after an experience.

Some impressions had a really bat affect in our lives, less say there was a time were maybe the only impression that some had was really not the one he wanted, but was the only one he could do, for example let say that there is a student in a classroom, maybe he is not feeling good, and he fart that it makes a realy loud some, and that everyone in the class hear it, his first impression will be to act normal but he could not act normal, because he knows that it was so loud that everyone heard him, so his going to feel shame of him self, his face is going to get red, and his hears and but thats something you can not control.

The feeling that some get at the firs impression is almost like something you don't have every day, well if you have embarrassing moment every time them you may get the wired feeling every day. Went you get the firs impression and is not every day situation is almost all time shame, confusion, uncomfortable, some times pain. But when is a every day thing, them is almost all the time happynes, like the feeling I get went my family ask me embarrassing questions or we have embarrassing moments. Is almos all the time happiness. Because it is a very day thing that they ask me things that it makes me uncomfortable.

The experiences that people get went they have a lot of firs impressions, are so impressive that they can act normal in a lot of situation,

for example went they were use to act embarrass or shame now they are capable to act normal, because of the experience that they had. Like I personable had a lot of experience that now insted of feel shame or embarrass I only get happiness. like went my mom ask me if i had a girlfriend I only smile or answer her that i do not and it is all normal, or at school went my friends ask me if I'm dating the girl I like, the answer I give them is yes or not, like a normal student, I dont get shame or anything. Because I had some experience during my life that it make me feel normal now.

I hope that in the future one day, when someone ask me something embarrass, and make me get a moment when my first impression is shame, or embarrass my feeling don't show up, and my experiences take place, for it not to have more affect in the moment, and make it more embarrassing than what it is already, because I dont want it to make me lost my mine, and make the moment the worst one in my life.

It could also help you out with other situations through out life. This is why you should talk to more than one person when asking for advice, you can get other peoples opinions, the way others understand your situation, you can see situations differently.

When you talk to more than one person to ask for advice you can get other peoples opinion. Everyone you know thinks differently. Sometimes people may have some of the same thoughts but not every situation has the same solution. What one person has to say is different from what another person says.

People understand things differently. Some people you talk to will not understand your situation. They will not see the situation the way you see it. If they do not completely understand your situation they could say the wrong thing. When they say the wrong thing it could make your situation a lot worse. You should always have multiple people you know you can trust and you could talk with to ask for advice in any situation. While others will know exactly what to say and do because they probably have been in situations like yours.

You can see other situations differently. When you talk to more than one person to ask for advice you start to see things differently. It changes the way you think about any situation. You will have an open mind and you will know what to say when other people ask you for advice. Knowing what to do when other people ask you for advice can help you out with a lot through life. It can help build stronger relationships and people can trust you. Trust is very important because people can talk to you about anything and you will know how to react and what to say.

In conclusion, talking to more than one person to ask them for advice can help you make the better choice. It can also help you out with other situations later in life. This is why you should talk to more than one person when asking for advice, you can get other peoples opinions, the way others understand your situation, you can see situations differently.

3487,EE855A723FE0,"First of all Hello, Ms. In my opinion I think that is better to work in group. I have 3 reasons that I would like to share with you my reasons are that everyone would like to share differents ideas, Also working in group we can finish more early, and we can socialized with different people. Now I'm going to describe you why I choose this reasons. By sharing ideas I meant that everyone can have the opportunity to think and talk about that that person think. Because we don't have the same's idea's as other people thought. After all people in the group share their ideas we can writte in a piece of paper and see which one's are good and makes any sence, about the topic we are talking and we see which one's we can put on the class work we are going to do. Also about that we can finish more early, we can show it to the teacher on time and she can give as her opinion and ask her for some help about what part she think that we can add more especific words or meanings. Because sometimes we think that we have a good project but sometimes we have to figure out what part we can change and put differents things. And the last but not least that we socialized with other's this one is my favorite because in this one I can discribe a little bit of my self when I just came to this country from another I was so shy because no one came to talk to me in my second day of school. In my English class my teacher make a groups and some people start talking with me 2 person from that class help me in my english because it wasn't that good. I was so scare because first everyone was looking to me like I had something in my face and in this country everything is different to my country in this one we need some friends that help us when we need some help in english.

Them I introduce my self to everyone and I start making new friends. When we are new we think that no one is going to talk with us because we are from another country. Sometimes they don't talk with us because we don't speak the same lenguage as other. But we have to try our best to be friendly and make that the person doesn't feel shy we would like to that person feel happy in school and in each classes. Tha's why I think that is good to be working in group not alone. When we have homework or projects we like to have some help then doing by our self that is more hard, the projects are always so difficult or sometimes you don't understand what the teacher said because we are seatting on the back and some students are talking and we could't hear anything about what the teacher is talking about. But in a group they are 2 or more then 2 in the same group is good that one of that person of your group understand and explain to the people didn't get it. The internet is a big problem to alot of us some of us that we don't have internet or computer eather. I think that is a problem for me and one of the reasons that I like working in groups some family doesn't have enough money to put internet in home or buy a computer in home but also go to a public places that have internet and computer we have to pay. But working in group one of the students may have internet and go to that person home. I know that in our school we have computers in the library but on weekends is close the school or some of us we can't stay after school. Because we have to pick our littler brother or sister from other school. But the good thing is that one of us could have computer or internet in home and research some things about our work or project. Another thing that is good working in group is that when we are explaining a project in from in class we don't feel ready because we have to talk a lot or others reasons but in groups we can break parts and each one is going to talk about that part she or he loves more.

My Final opinion that I would like to share is that working is group is a good option then working by our self. Because not all of us have the opotunity to have internet, not all of us speak english some of us we need that someone speak our language for example sometimes I need someone that help me with some words in english that I don't understand because my first language is spanish and it's hard came to a country that don't speak your native language. And we can know new people to talk, not with the sameones because there is a lot of people that we don't talk and they are in the same classes of us we just want to be with the same ones and have to talk with everyone and help then when they need help.

When you left trash then later it will smell bad. Some people hated when this happened. Please don't leave thrash on the floor put it in the trash can.

Second reason is that when there's a event the people who work there have to clean up before the event starts. Some people think that takes too much time away but no. They just want to help people and the community. In school is the same thing friends doesn't want to help and some to.

Last reason is that there's too much to clean up and during the night. Janitors need to clean up during the night because when the next day comes it will be clean and neat. Some people clean up their stuff alone and sometimes together.

1824,89863E1AF982,"Should the first impressions care and show who individuals are? First impressions are almost impossible to change that is why people always have to worry about their actions because people can not go back the time, can lose opportunities, and can get on trouble.

First of all, people can not go back the time and try to fix what they had done wrong. For example, some individuals who gave a bad impression in their first time at work because they did not how to deal with the costumer and they had a bad attitude but then the next day they realized that they have to change their attitude it may be too late because the costumers already complained. All in all, people have to do their best the first time even if life is too difficult because time does not come back.

In addition, Individuals can lose opportunities by their first impressions. For instance, some people that apply to a job but they did not present on time will give their new boss a bad impression about them that he or she will want to fire them. All in all,people always has to make a good impression the first time and they will have better opportunities.

However, some people may argue that first impressions can be change because people may have regrets and they will try to apply themselves and do their best in what they did wrong in the past .This argument is weak though because not everything in life can be change easily. For example, some people may regrets how they were in high school with their teachers but they can not do nothing now because some of their teacher already past away. Even though, first impressions are impossible to change because no all the time people will have the opportunities to a second chance.

Finally, people can get on trouble for how they show the first time. For example,some individuals that deal with other people always has to give a great impression the first time. Additionally, people that works at a restaurant has to have a good appearance because if they do not have it they will lose costumers,lose their jobs. In a word, a good impression the first time will save people from trouble.

People always have to be careful in what they show or do the first time. There are great reasons for always make a good impression the first time because individuals can not go back the time,can lose opportunities, and can get on trouble.

573,2B9FE67B7465,"Thesis

: I believe that my school should not fallow this model because a lot of people get tired of school. Teachers get more tired than students because they work all year to make our classes and teachers need a break from school more than us, the students.

It is okay to go to the school the five days of the week. It doesn't matter how hard school is, if you go the five days of the week you get less tired because classes are more shortest and you don't have to be is school the whole day. Also you have more time outside of school to go to work or go with your friends to have fun and forget of school for a bit.

First, if schools do extend classes is gonna be more stressful and tired because you are going to be in school for a longest time and a lot of people don't even like school. Some people really hate school because is really hard for everyone and there are some classes that you don't even have an idea of what you are doing. Teachers know when someone is tired and they let them sleep for a while because maybe they know how is it feel being tired. Schools need to have the same schedule and don't change anything.

Second, schools are not like work in a job because in a job, you have more responsibilities and they also have rights that you need to comply. Being in a job is the double stressful and tired than being in your school learning a lot of new things. Some people say that work is better than go to school, but I say that they all are wrong because sometimes in school you do nothing, you just are listening to what the teacher says and in a job if you have a little break, you use it to eat or make another job that you need to do later.

They should not extend the school day but the should do it with jobs.

Third, if schools extend classes you won't have time to sleep well. That's the most important thing for students, sleep well to come to the school with a good attitude. A lot of people talk about other's attitude because they are always angry, bored, or lazy but they have no idea if they sleep well or not. Some people make fun of them because they fall to sleep in classroom and that's not right, the right thing is ask that person how is he feel, or if he is okay. The less you sleep, the most tired you get and sometimes you don't even can concentrate in classroom. Most of the students that don't sleep well and they have a job after school, they have a hard time in school because most of the times being in school is stressful as a job.

Conclusion

: Is not necessary to extend school day two more hours because it's gonna be the same any ways. Two more hours in four days don't change anything because is like you are adding Friday in that four days. The same eight hours in Friday, you are going to add to the four days of classes. They don't need to change anything because teachers won't have enough time to get ready our classes for the next day and they won't have time to even cook food at home or clean their house. Sometimes students above 18 years old live single and they need to work every single day because they need a lot of money to pay their bills like: house, car, phone, internet, food, and clothes. Some of them are about to have a baby and having a baby is a huge responsibility for him because he need to work over time to win more money or have two job. He is gonna be really really stressful and tired, and he won't have time to come to the school the whole day.",4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,1
2452,B6ADED946A1A,"Hello Ms or Mr teacher,

I'm writing this for convince you to don't work in groups ,and here are my cons and pros about working alone or in groups. The benefits of working with a group, or working alone are complete differents because some people feel more comfortables working alone than working in groups. In my oppinion working alone is much better than working in groups. In some cases your teammates of you group don't participates in the work or they don't want to work in groups. I feel more comfortable working alone for many reasons.

First reason , I can do whatever I want to do in the work or do the work in my way, but in some cases the person who work alone doesn't know how to do the work in this case is good to work in group because maybe your teammates knows the answers of the work.

Second, If I work alone I have more chances to unertand the work by my self without distractions. Because in some cases your teammates of your groups are distract you or other teammates of the group.

Third, working alone can be more benefict than working in groups because you can learn more things about the work, and do it in the way you like the work, without worry about what your group is doing. If we work alone we will have the opportunite of learn more about the work.

I know working in groups are the easy way because maybe your teammates of you groups knows the answers of the work, and you dont have to worry about the work because you know your teammates will do the work for you . But in some cases people who don't participate in the work gets credits in the work what he or she doesn't participates it. And that isn't fair for you or your teammates who did the work.

That's why you should sonsiderate us to do not work in groups anymore.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.2,1
2088,9CB6D9467227,"I agree that a positive attitude is the key to success in life because people are Motivated , Happier and Work harder. Many people disagree that having a positive attitude doesn't mean anything and others think it makes a huge impact in success. Many studies have shown that having a positive attitude helps people succeed better and is a key.

First, I truly believe that if you really stay motivated and I'm convinced that I want to be successful, I continue to push myself each time I want to give up. When I pay attention to the certain things I want to achieve. I give dedication when I want one specific thing and try not to worry about other things that aren't related to what I want or succeed. I try to stay as focused as possible because once I'm determined and make that my main focus, then It'll make me want to keep my positive energy towards my goal.

Secondly, If I want to have a positive energy I must remain Happy. If I truly believe in myself then I will continue to have a positive energy, but even if

I

don't believe in myself I will remain to have a positive energy and a positive attitude. By succeeding with a positive attitude I must prioritize my goal making it my first reason to stay positive and to work harder. Keeping it always in my mind and reminding myself; for example "" oh this is what I have to look for"" or ""this will help me by succeeding my goal I want to achieve"", those two examples are ways to bring it to my mind all the time and remember what I need to be looking for.

Thirdly, If I work harder by putting my all into it and dedicating my time and keeping my positive energy then that's one way i can always succeed. By keeping my energy positive and succeeding I will make work twice as much as I need to for my goal to come true. If I know i truly want that goal and what to succeed I won't give it up that easily because that will be my main focus and my main priority.

Having a positive attitude is a huge key to succes because people get motivated, happier and work harder for what they are trying to achieve in life. Many people disagree that having a positive attitude is a key to success and others think it's a huge difference when you do because that's peoples main focus in life. Always have a positive attitude for the things a person including yourself may want in life! ",2.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.2,1
1446,6EF7CBB46501,"The statement that the author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote about to do something else just to be someone in the world, it is completely an error. I disagree with this statement, since, I believe that every person think differently. For example, people has their own ideas and ways how to do their own business. Everyone can make a biggest impact in the world, but, by doing what they love. Not what others think that it could be beneficial for you. To be someone in a world you should believe in yourself, make right decisions, and success.

First of all, people could enter in your mind by telling you what could be beneficial for your life or carer. Some of them accept their opinion and do what they do not like, or love. For example, when students are thinking in what career they want to study. Parents influence in their choices by telling about what career would be properly for them. However, those ""properly careers"" it is not in their list of careers they want to study. This action make some teenangers to take that step of let parents choice by themselves.

Otherwise,

they do not help them to mature or even take responsabilities. Everyone should believe in themselves by doing whatever they love, without any interpose in accomplish their dreams. Since, we have the right to build them, it does not matter if we commit an error. Because of our capacities to avoid them or even get over it and keep going.

People has the right to make big choices in life. Making decisions it is hard and important because it could be beneficial, or even worst. However, if you choice with your heart it might be right but by the time you can change your mind. But, you won't regret it about those decisions because as they say, ""You have to learn for every error you commit to be success."" This means that we learn through the past of the time every fall, because you have to stand up and continue your life. It helps us to growing our knowledge to build a better version of ourselves.

Finally, by being confidence to yourself helps you to surpass any obstacle. Beliving in your ideas and trying to make it come true, it tells us that you are persist person chasing for your dreams. Which is quite favorable for person in any career or even job. Because of seeking to be successful at your own way, by do not depend about what others can say. Everyone has a differently perspective than others by doing what you love without any ""obligation"" or to be oppresed.

In conclusion, I am not accorded by this statement, since, we have different points of view. However, I believe that every human being can make their dreams come true without any oppression by others. People should stand by themselves by starting to be confidence in their belief. Also, by being patience on making important decisions, since, everything takes time. And, do not be afraid on doing what you love because it brings you to the way to be success.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.5,3.4,1
229,10DA9316D02D,"This program helps students to learn new things,helps older students to mature of teaching and taking it seriously,and helps younger students to socialize with new people and to communicate,and prepares the older students to prepare lessons and teach and be more organized,it can also help older and younger students to learn new different skills and learn different ways.

The first best thing about having programs for younger and older students is for the younger students can learn new things. I think it's best to teach young people to learn new things because it can prepare them in the future. I think that the program can help the younger students for they can learn interesting new things and for they can decide what they want to be in the future. If the younger students get help from the older students to learn new things it's good because for they can use that information and teach other kids what they have learn from the older students. I think this program can help many other young students to learn new things from the older students because it's a better way for the students for can use what they have learn and use it for something for their future life like for example math they can use that for paying taxes and bills I think that this program can help students learn new things.

The second, thing that is good about this program,is the older kids can mature from teaching younger students and learn how to be more thinkable about what to teach and how to teach something. I think that this program is good because the older student learn how to focus more on what they are able to teach the younger students. The reason why I think the program is a good learning resource is because when the older students know more things than the younger students they can decide what do they need help on learning what should I teach them and how do I teach the subject to them so it makes the older students more focus to how to know how teach a younger students and the best way to help them. It helps older students because they can think in a better way and to make them feel more grown up teaching someone that is younger than them. This program helps older students because it makes them think more harder and it also teaches the older students how to think more ideas and thin what happens if they teach that, or well this lesson help them, and makes them ask questions to themselves.

The third reason, how this program can help younger students, is because the younger students can communicate more to new people they don't know. I think that this program helps younger students to communicate more is because if they talk to more new people that are helping them they well be less shy and it well make it less difficult for them to be shy to talking to someone new. I think that this program helps younger student to learn better to communicate is because they can get more confidence, and not be scared to talk in front of someone new and different. I think that this program dose help younger students with communication because when they talk to someone new they can feel more comfortable talking to more people and be more social. This program helps younger people to communicate because when they talk to someone it can help them to be less scared to like present projects and talk to a crowd.

The fourth reason, why this program helps older students to prepare for lessons and be like a more organized,thinkable person. I think that this program dose help older students be more organized is because they think what they are gonna teach them and what the younger students are struggling on. I think that this program dose help a lot of certain older students be organized because they think what time,and day,where they are gonna teach the lessons to the younger students. I think that this program dose really help the older students to be organized cause it makes them more prepare what they are gonna teach and how they are gonna teach it so basically, the older students think were to put what. Why I think that this program dose help older students to be more organized because they plan everything in order.

The last,reason why I think this program is great is because it helps both younger and older students to help each other and to improve there learning skills. I think this program dose help both young and older students because if they all work together and help each other it can make a difference on helping and making people learn in a way certain way an easier way. I think that this program dose help younger and older students cause they can both share their learning skills how they learn things and shares ideas. I think this program helps because all the younger students and older students teach each other things and help them get better at something they are having trouble at doing. I think this program dose help cause it helps every students to learn a easy way to learn in different ways like flashcards,reading something over and over again,watching turturiols videos on how to do a equation or math so this program helps to find the best skill for you. It helps for all the students for they can learn faster and easier and help others find their best learning skill to focus on what they are learning.

It helps both older students and younger students to improve there learning skills and it's a good program to learn new interesting things to help students for the future.    ",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.7,1
1159,599128B82FF0,"Careers are important to succeed in life. students are interesting in a career that can help them in the future or in the present. In my personal life, I used to assist to a barbering career, I learn the basics. This had help me to cut some people hair by this I earn some extra money while I am In High School. Any career is hard but is vital in life. I believe that it is a good idea for students to join a career in a young age because they gain more experience, students can work in a young age. These are two major things why they should participate, sooner I'll explain it.

Students could gain more experience in a particular career. This is because the brain still fresh and is perfect to learn new things. Teenagers would be able to learn new things everyday. They can learn how to solve a simple thing, for example at home with electrical or mechanical issue. Furthermore, students could be able to be masters in the future of any career. They could be experts because they will have a longer period of time to practice and keep finding stuff to learn. If a person have experience they can even become managers.

A career would help to find better jobs. sometimes people see careers as a waste of time but, if a person go to a job with a career taking;that person is able to earn money. If a person have experience they can even become managers. Besides, students are able to work in a young age. They could work in summer break. I believe that this can help them to save money to go to college. Furthermore, teenagers are capable to practice their skills.

In conclusion, any career can be useful to succeed in life. Teenagers are able to choice their future. They could master the career to perfection. Students, because they are young they have time to learn a lot. They should decide to join one before is too late. This can help them to have a better future.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.3,1
2302,ABBE700093F0,"A city council is debating the adoption of a 10 p. m. weekday and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers. If the curfew is adopted, teenagers on the streets after those hours would be breaking the law. Do curfews keep teenagers out of trouble, or do they unfairly interfere in young people lives?

Curfew helps young kids to stay out of trouble because it can be dangerous. For example, if they just wording around at night they don't know what can happened like they can get kidnap, and be at a place at a wrong time. They can think it's cool but in reality it's not. If a police men stop or pull you over you can get in to trouble because they gonna ask if your parents know you out or if they know where you at and if you said no they gonna call you parents and ask them to come and get you.

Sometimes your parents can get worry if you not home. Kids want to meet up with there friends just to hang out but is it really worth it or to get in trouble knowing your friends ain't gonna have your back. Curfew keep teens from getting in trouble. Although curfew can be good but it shows that your parents can trust you. Night can be really dangerous because you can't see in the dark and you don't know what can be out there. There can be drunk drivers at night also.

Curfew is a law so if you go out late at night you would be breaking the law. Police man really do be canning this serious. All they want is kids to stay safe and be good also to listen to their parents. Teens think that meeting up with there friends at night is cool. But parents just want there kids to behave and listen so they won't get in serious trouble. Why lose your parent trust over some friends that ain't gonna talk to you later in life. Be smart on what side you try to be. Not everything is all about friends you gotta put your parents first then your friends that why them made a curfew.

Plus it the matter of respect for your parents.

Curfew actually helps teens from doing wrong things. Teens don't think that there parents gonna find out but when they get that call saying mom you gonna get nervous or scared because you dont't know what to say for being at late. Parents can be smart at times when they want to but they do be catching here kids in the act of sneaking out ! Teens really do have a choice by picking stay home or go out and have fun. People really care about this law. Who wanna see a kid walking alone without no parent around. Teens just need to sleep or play on there gaming systems . You can hang out with your friends during the day or have a sleep over . Whatever you can do to hang out with your friends but DON'T GO SNEKING OUT TO GO GET FOOD OR TO BE WITH YOUR GRILFRIEND! Just stay at home call up your friends or even your girlfriend so you won't put your self at a higher risk of getting in trouble.

Overall just stay out of trouble and have your parents trust. Don't do nothing stuiped. Stay at home make do homework or watch a movie just don't sneake out jsut to do stuff thats gonna get you in trouble.",2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.7,1

3862,FE459F8CF4CE,"""A problem is a chance for you to do your best"", this phrase said by the American jazz legend Duke Ellington means that if you have a problem you can use it to improve yourself and I agree with this statement because problems can help you by making your brain grow up, giving you knowledge, and making your personality stronger.

Problems make your brain to grow up, imagine being on a math test and you don't know the answer, probably you will be scared but if you try hard to remember what is the answer you will find it, usually problems are too hard to solve and this fact helps you to make your brain to think a way to solve the problems, this can cause your brain to grow up by using all your energy to think in what you can do in this situation.

Problems gives you knowledge, there should be a reason for you to be in a problem, if you fight in the school or anywhere with another person or you do something bad, probably someone will call you to the office or take you to the police department , if you are in a problem the first thing you will do is think on why this happened and this helps you because you will know what you did bad and will not do it again.

Problems makes your personality stronger, if you crash your car you may feel bad and scared for this event, I had a test that it was hard and in that moment I felt bad, so most of the time when you have a problem you will feel stressed, this stress can be bad for your brain but it can also help you to be more patient and determined in your goal that is solving your problem, with this two things your personality will be stronger that before the problem.

In conclusion, I think that Duke Ellington is right because problems can help you by making your brain grow up, giving you knowledge, and making your personality stronger. So if you are in a problem you should take the lead of this situation and be determined in solving it, is not the end of the world only because you have a problem, and now you know that problems can help you.",3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1

Visiting your work space can help others understand what your do. Visiting your company could help understand how things are made at your company and what your goal is for the future of your company. This visit will help me understand how the people are too.

Visiting your company could help people understand what you do at your work space. Looking at a work space can help people see what the company is working on.

Opening your company to people would help them understand what kind of things you need to work here. This could help chosing colleges and schools.

448,21B100A503DC,"Churchill statement is right because failing in life is part of succeeding. Those obsticals you go through in life are part of who you become and how you handle those obsticals. It gives some type of motivation to keep moving forward and get to whatever goal it is. My example is when i got pregnant my junior year and when I found out i just wanted to drop out because I was still a kid myself and I kept thinking how people would look at me or what would they say, but I already had an idea. My parents didnt even support me so what motivation did I have? I had myself and my son. I took that as my motivation, yes it was difficult especially after I delivered and going back to school because I was very behind. Of course a lot of friends stopped talking to me but that just proves who's there for you and who's not. I was starting a new chapter in my life and I'm not saying having my son was a mistake but it was just at the wrong time; cant change the past though, you just have to keep moving forward.

Here I am now my senior year, eight more months until I graduate and I'm proud of myself because I am a mother now and I'm still going to school, I didnt let that stop me from getting my education and I'm planning to go to college too because all I want is the best for my son and myself; its not me I have to think about now, I have another responsibility to look after for. There are many examples of failing in life and later on succeeding but this is one I went through, I had to grow up fast but it made me the person I am today.

Elective classes are really easy. Students will have less stress about worrying that they will fail to meet the requirement to pass their school. when the class become an elective class there will be less home work this will allow students to get an easy credit to pass the class. if this was an requirement class it would be more hard and if the students don't pass the class they will have to repeat it.

Students that are not good at music, drama and art will try their best to pass. but if they fail that means they have to do it over again until they pass it. But as an elective class student don't have to be good in it to pass. But even so the student don't like the classes but they still try to go for the free extra credit.

Requirement classes is a class that students have to take in order to graduate but most of the of the student don't want to take it. Elective classes are suitable for those students because the student that did not want to take it can switch to another class that they are good at. Student that did not want to take the requirement class will skip and don't care about it. Elective class are the best they are not hard as an requirement.

3762,F9E1434B2151,"Throughout the course of our history,education has always been placed amongst the most important necessities,as it not only helps us learn and better ourselves,but because it also opens new doors and possibilities for us. In the past,schools couldn't offer differing alternatives,because technology wasn't as present as it is today. Schools can now offer education to students,all while being at different locations. By students taking classes at home,they'll be able to benefit because they won't feel as socially distressed as they would in person,the level of education could be better and possibly help them graduate earlier,and they wont't have to endure social issues, such as bullying. Many people tend to believe that because they go to school,they won't have a hard time adjusting and fitting in with the masses,but to contrary beliefs,there's a lot of people who do struggle with social anxiety and overall,tend to have a hard time fitting in. Firstly,an example of this, is my cousin Generic_Name. He does have friends,but he feels extremely overwhelmed by being around so many different people,mostly because he's always struggled with social anxiety. Generic_Name decided that he would still like to pursue and attain his education,so he started looking for different alternatives that could help him do so. After much research and gathering of information,he concluded that distance learning was the best choice for him,as he wouldn't have to endure overwhelming amounts of people,or feel pressured by the constant necessity of having to wake up early during the mornings. Another example would be my friend Generic_Name,who never really had problems of fitting in and making friends,but overall disliked the whole ordeal of the school system itself. She then decided to pursue her education through another medium,that medium being,distance learning. Secondly,what a majority of people don't tend to realize,is the fact that you could achieve a better education,and even graduate at an earlier rate. This is another benefit of distance learning. Many people tend to believe that attending school,actually decreases their chances of being able to graduate early and of becoming more independent from their families at a younger age. Many individuals throughout the course of the world,utilize distance learning because they would like to achieve their educations at a faster pace,than those who are enrolled in schools. A prime example of this,is my friend Generic_Name. He was an excellent student while at school,but he wanted to find a way of being able to take advanced courses,that not only prepared him for college and provided him with advanced credits,but also helped him graduate at an earlier age. Generic_Name is now a professional,with a degree in marine biology. He achieved these accomplishments,all at the young age of 25. Another example would be my other friend,Generic_Name. She had always excelled at school,but she wanted an alternative that provided her with a better education and a chance of being able to enroll into college at a younger age. After much thought and consideration,and much conversation with her family and peers,she ultimately decided that distance learning was the best choice. As of now,Generic_Name has graduated at the young age of 17,and is estimated to graduate out of college at the young age of 19. Finally, an issue,that as of now,still affects many schools around the world,is bullying. Bullying has been an issue that has always caused concern amongst the masses,and sadly,it's an issue that is still ongoing till this day. Among the many issues that affect public schools throughout the whole world,bullying is still one of the most commonly and frequently mentioned. Despite the benefits of not feeling pressured,being able to pursue a better education and graduating at an early age,distance learning is also an alternative that many people, who've unfortunately been victims of bullying,provides them an opportunity of being able to continue with their studies,and a feeling that they are no longer exposed to issues,such as bullying. An example of this,is my friend Generic_Name. During his first couple of years in high school,he was brutally mocked for always standing out amongst his peers,and he not only felt massively insecure, but he also developed many social problems and insecurities. He had tried many alterning ways of possibly pursuing an education without having to worry about being mocked,until he finally discovered distance learning. He discovered,that he could still attend his classes and carry on with his regular school activities,all while being at the comfort of his very own home. Luckily for Generic_Name,his bullies actually turned out to be massively underachieving,so much so,that they ended up being expelled from school. He then decided to return to school,and luckily for him,he started to fit in. If it wasn't for distance learning,Generic_Name wouldn't have graduated his freshman year,or his sophomore year. People shouldn't really be afraid of trying alternatives that differ from the norm,they should always read and educate themselves on the pros and cons of distance learning. As technology continues to expand beyond realms we could've ever have possibly imagined,the future of education could one day narrow down to distance learning. ",3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.3,1
702,35D983476332,"Dear. Reader's

It's all my pleasure to be writing this answer, thank you for give me this opportunity to express my opinion and ideas based on my experiences. Even if my answer is agree or disagee; i believe that the life is short and you never know when is going to end. The first impression too but in this case we can know when is going to finish because is a big different between this two. I'm disagree with the statement that the first impressions are almost impossible to change, i believe that we can change the first impression but not in one second i'm gonna tell you some reason the i feel with my experiences that i want to know you.

First, ""the first impression the you receive is very important"" Well i'm not sure of that but is something that other poeple say, so we can think that for one moment maybe is true; because for some people is important the what other people think about them so put this case and the table and start think why base on my experience i""m not going to say that is true but i can give you one reason that i think. Well is depent the who is the person because if is a boy who you like you wanna receive a good impression but if is not pass the time you or him can change the impression because now you alredy know the person the boy the point is the time why? because the first impression is a second but also you can change pass on time.

Second, the impression is how you look like or the expression on your face good we find another point because is other impression the we can change and you gonna think how well this is a situation before one year ago i was talk with a person and she look in the first mad, but she wasn't mad the face of her was express mad but she wans't pas the time more and more my so my first impression was the she was mad now i think the oppossed of her

The time is the words more important in the life that we can stop or pass and also we can forget because his live in our life but the impression is something the we can forget the we can pass and something the can't lived in us because is something that we can change is something that we can move.

In conclusion everything is based on time and if you ask me that if is a possible change the first impression i'm gonna say yes because you never going to forgot the first impression the you receive from other person but you can also change later and your mind or in your background. Always we can change something thanks for everything.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,1
2846,CEE41F7526FA,"I have some reasons why I would disagree with the school board because I don't like the idea of staying more time in school. Either way it is not a good idea because the school would face alot of work with the time extended plus it's gonna be more work than ever with the school extending. And I have a lot of reasons why its a bad idea so I guess start the reading the paragraphs right now.

First extending the school day would get a lot of students mad at the school because they want to go home and do whatever they want. The students would have to stay longer in the school and some would be mad and some be happy about it. And students that are bulllies would have a bigger chance on picking on people during the extended time of school. The next day the school would most likely be getting emails from students and parents complaining about the extended school day. While other students and parents wont care and go to school like a normal day and al lot more.

Also the jobs in the school could change like the teachers job and other jobs in the school time would be extended. Some teachers would complain by the extended school day if there gonna do a extended day everyday they are gonna have to be payed more or else the school would die slowly because all teachers,staff and other jobs in the school would quit and go work somewhere else better and get paid more. If one teacher does quit their job because of the extended time he/she would most likely tell other people that the school is terrible then the school would barely get people to work there and in a couple years later probably the school would be abandoned for other people to explore to see the leftovers of the dead school.

Finally the school would change by alot than before it ever has in its couple years of existance. The school would have to face a lot of consequnces like a lot of students posting on the internet about how the school is trash,boring and now they want to go to a different school. And the teachers would complain about if they are going to teach more than ever they want to get bad even more money. And they would have to change the whole school time of the day,the bus time and the students classes time which would took a very long time to do. Either way other jobs in the school would be more difficult than ever for example janitors,staff and teachers.

Even though the school really does want to change original time to a extended time it's not the smartest idea in the world because theres gonna end up being consequnces to it and they are not going to be fun for anyone. Either way next thing you know the county that owns the school will just die because of the extended day. Because then who knows probably no one then later on wants to go the either school in the county anymore and would probably just moved out to go to a better school. So this is why this idea is a bad idea. ",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,1
1492,732952FF57F2,"For the time students get to high school, Is time for the students to focus more on their future. Students that go to high school are expecting to do more work and be with a different mind set. Going to high school, is the time when students need to think what they want to do in the future, and pick a career that they like. But there are many students, that don't care about their futures, others don't think about their futures in high school. High school is the time when students are able to get focus and think about a career they wanna take. Also to pick a career that you like,and you enjoy doing it. But there are many students that take career just to take them but thats no the career they like so they end it up not achieving nothing.

In high school, is where a lot of students work so they can get money and buy what they want and Also to pay their college career. So identify a career by the time students get to high school help. Because now the students now how much does the career cost, and where he can go studied when he finish high school. Also choosing a career when your young helps, because students have more time to get more information, about the career. And see if there are others career that students would like to take. So thats why committing to a career by the time you get to high school helps you, have more time to view different careers and choose the one u like the best.

Many student that are almost in high school, think about how high school going to be like. So been able to choose a career before high school helps. Because the student can get their mind set and think about what courses the student wants to take in high school. Those courses can help, because it teach the student the things that he needs to learn therefore hes prepare the career, he wants to take. And also to be able to search where the he wants to go studied and pick the collage that teach the best for his career.

And finally preparing for a career before high school, gives the students more opportunities. So I agree for students to identify a career by the time they enter high school. also high school has a lot opportunities, for students that wants to take collage course. So they can be prepare for their careers, and when they get to collage they now a lot about the career they want to take. So it helps committing to a career before going to high school it can get you prepare for your future. And acomplish what you want for your future.    ",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.4,1

I think that if the people that are aroud you wants to chage you is becuase they love how you are and want to be like you ; That best thing that you can do is get away from the people and make new ones that are possive and help you to become a better person, human. The worse thing that you can do is change because of others.

People treated you bad becuase they want to accomplish their goal that is break you into pieces but, if you don't let those commen, actions hurt you everything is going to okay. Last year there were some girls that detely were hurting me my feels. In adition, Every day they would told me dress good you have to be like this act like you are a model; They would also make fun of me too because i was dressing so poorly. i was wearing the same shoes every day same pants. When they saw me they would make the face like they were going to trow up. Therefore, i never let them make my self esteem go down. I was so possitive also my family give me good vibes too, They would told me you know were you wanna get at. You know your goals those are the want you have to pay attention to.

Inconclution, don't let people make you something else. Some people think that you are going to change because they want but, they are wrong because you can be however makes you feel great with yourself. In the future i see that nobody is going to judge you.     ",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.6,1

when i was young i wanted to be good at soccer but when i play with my cousings they allways make fun of me, and i stare crying i never try to be good a soceer never. then i was always staying after to play with peolpe at my age, I was getting better and better at soccer, and after like one year after i went to my aunt house my cousings told me to play with then, they were surprise because better then they.

When i first came to USA all my family was tellimg to learn english. First when i was learning a little be of english, and my teacher told me to practice english in the class (talk to others students in class), but i was scare that the student make fun of me, so that day i did not spoke english in class i told my self ( i going to learn and make my self proud)

at the end of the school year my english was better i was always epeaking english with my sister and to my teachers too.

Others people think taht if you can""t do something you have to stop doing it or stop trying, others will told you that you can""t do it, but remember you can do everything you propouse .

So if you want to do something just do it don't be afraid of failing doesn't matter if you fail you can keep trying to do it make your family proud meke your self proud. Life is beautiful try to get your goals done. And remember you can do anything you want just if you try really hard.

3079,DAE1AA29184B,"Should Generic_School extended school day's by two hours for four day's a week? My opinion about this is we shouldn't let this happen for many reasons for example; Students would be waking up late,People got jobs after school and responsivbles after school, Students wouldn't have time to do homework and actives after school. Having to go to school for four days would be great and all but I would rather go to school for that extra day then just four days for ten hours. Other people would agree with me and my reason why we shouldn't let this happen. I'll give you more detail reasons about why we shouldn't let this happen.

My first reason, Students would be waking up late to school, It's very important to go to school and people waking up late could cause a lot of problems with the government and with parents. The student attendance would drop a lot, Students would be waking up later on in the day, And would be missing a lot of class work in the moring that could be important. That they would have to make up which could be hard because they would have to stay after for school if we would have ten hours of school and it would be hard to do it in class. If we didn't have two hours added to are day then it would be much easier to stay after school, And students would be waking up on time and going to school more often.

Next reason,Some students have jobs after school and responsivbles. If we would have ten hours of school it would be impossibe to take care of those thing. Having a job is important some students could be going through tuff times like family issues,Some students even have kids to take care .Some students got a lot to handle that and school work and going to school. Other students they got other thing to do for example vist people family members,having chores to do around the house.

Now,My last reason would be students wouldn't have time to do homework and actives after school. There are alot of students who stay after for help with there homework, Clubs and sports,some students enjoying staying after and practicing to join the soccer team,foorball team etc. Students even have time to work on there homework when they get out of school. If we would have added two more hours then we wouldn't have sport or staying after, It would probably be late and teachers don't want to stay longer then they should and parnets could get worryed about the kids for staying longer. These actives could affect students class work, How tired the students get and sore when they come back from school.

In conclusion, We shouldn't add two more hours to the school day for four days a week it could affect students attendents and how they act with others,People have jobs and responsivbles after school and students actives and homework. That's why we should keep the school days nomal and how long we stay in school. Student's come to school on time and prepare to learn. They do want they have to do after school and everyone is happy with that,Others will be unhappy if we would add two more hours to are day.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.1,1
2626,C277BE295A41,"Being true to yourself in a world so cruel is the best to accomplishment. The most important lessons life can give is stand your ground, be more forward with certain individuals, cut what seems to be negative. Individuality can always be a good, sometimes you never need that helping hand because not everyone is helpful. Some try to be the bad person by stepping over you.

Most experiences, I myself have gone through were never the best. Everyone might seem like the good person, but we never know what is really behind them. First off, you should simply just stand your ground. Show them that not everything is meant to be worked within two people.

Another reason, achieving things on your own shows you a lot of things you never knew before. One of those might be you have made through school by yourself and got your diploma. Accomplishment comes with many struggles and steps. Not just anyone makes it through; some give up because maybe others told them that not everything is for them.

Lastly, cut out certain people that you know never got you anywhere. Everyday is a lesson if we recognize it or not. Some days are harder than others, but there is never a day you should give. Every job can be easy with a positive mindset.

2771,CB327222A71B,"I agree with the Author Emerson wrote, ""To be yourself in a word that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"", because the most important in this world is to be yourself. To be yourself is to make you unique and different for the others. Some of things is important to be yourself is: To be yourself, to achieve goals by yourself, and don't let others people tell you to be different.

The first is to be yourself. Some people things if you don't be yourself is to make you successful in their life, but the case is not that. To be yourself is make the people in your work, family, and friends see the real person you are. In my case when I came in the United States, I don't like to be myself because I was a little scared the kind of people was here. Every time people talk to me, they look me different. After we finished the conversation I feel bad because I know was not me. One afternoon my mom talk me, "" You need to be yourself, because inside you heart, you are a sweet person, beautiful, and you love help people."" In that moment I changed my life and the way I look people.

The second things is to achieve goals by yourself is motivate you to continue do the right choices, and the things right. To be yourself had more opportunities for work, universities, and scholarship. To be yourself don't only implicate be a good person or help people, is to implicate say the truth, the things you think, and never lie to others people. To achieve your goals and objective is make proud of yourself in this world completely of opportunities. For examples, my sister for her dedication, and to be herself, so right now she is in college. To be herself, she achieve their goals and dreams, and she always saying the truth.

The third things what is important is don't let other people tell you to be different. If always to be yourself, you always be successful in life. Some people say you needs to change because they are jealous or they don't like you. Whose say you needs to change is because they want the bad things for you. In my case, I don't remember very well, but one person say to me that, "" I need to change my personality."" In that same afternoon I go to tell my mom what this person say to me, and what my mom say to me was, "" Don't let any person to over shine the light you had.""

In my conclusion, I feel this is very important for all people need to reflect, in this life the most important things is be yourself don't matter what. The are three things that one person never forget is to be yourself, to achieve goals by yourself, and don't let other people tell you to be different. If you let people do what ever they want with you life, you never be successful in life.",2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.8,1
1339,66FF0907BF26,"Do you ever wonder if most students use their phones in school for educational purposes? In my opinion cell phone use in a classroom is not a bad thing depending weather they take advantage on getting work done or goof around the majority of the students in school take advantage of their phones about Seventy Five percent of students like to use their phones for social media and music. When teachers are in classes during instructional time about half the class is paying attention, the other half of the class is on their phones texting friends or updating social media and then don't know what the lesson is about when they get called on to answer questions on the board.

Phones are usually a distraction to teachers and also to the person using the phone. Phones can also be a positive thing when doing paper work or projects when listening to music it can help concentrate more without getting distracted from others peers. When listening to music when you're working it gives off a positive affect on your brain, it gets your mind going with different types of ideas and keeps you from falling asleep. Cell phones bring hundreds of resources that would be able to help you get answers or help you understand certain questions , meaning of words , and how to pronounce different type of sentences from other languages.

Most teachers don't allow phones or headphones in a classroom because they assume everyone's going to start texting and be on social media, cell phones are important to have close just in case of an emergency at home. In case if you wanna check up on your siblings, mom, or dad even if you can notify the school about contacting your parents or your parents contacting the school it'll be easier for them to call you.

Some schools usually provide tablets for students to use so they wouldn't have to worry about loosing an assignment or turning it in late, but the majority of the time you need internet to be able to open up assignmets to turn in school students usually have tablet problems and turn it in so it could get fixed. Cell phones is a big help it can usually download applications that you neeed to do work without being behind in certain subjects so there shouldn't be an excuses on why assignments are late, or missing and that's why cell phones are a positive affect for educational purposes as long as teachers are consistant on supervising students cell phone use.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.2,1
356,1B056DE0E856,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote "" unless you try to do something beyond what you have already master, you will never grow."" But i thing that when people work hard on something, even thou they all already don it, but they did poorly on it, So when they do it again thats haves them another opportunity to do it batter. For example when i was in eighth grade i had a lot of tribal how to spell in English, because i was from another country, could Generic_City. So all the time i could not spal a ward, so i will get sad, but in the minet or two i say to my self "" dont worry"" so to answer the cwesten that Author Ralph Waldo Emerson try to say, no i don`t believe that when people have already mastered in something they cant do it again.

First, Work hard, people work very hard in something because they want to secid in the futurr. When some one bin doing something for so long even thou they did moltipal times. They can do it again, just to be batter ate it. They never hive up on something, because when some one haves up on something that they bin like in it, they will fail. Think positive about staff because when some people dont thing positive. Even no it`s hard for them to desalt what they what to do in the future but they did the same thing over and over, but when they work had and have that positive mind they will do it well . For example, my first year playing soccer on the high school teem, it was hard for me to understand what people was saying to be, but two three years later i had no tribal understanding what they war saying to me. So that shows that i speak English for three years and know i can understand what people saying to me because i bin spike net for three years.

Second, Dont wary about staff, stay on track. People like to do something and finished, because when they finished it fills much better then before. When i take a test it makes me woride but when i finish it, it fills much better because my mined can relax form it. Even thou i still think what Caind of graid will get. Fist Complete the staff that is hard to do then do the easy staff later. When some people do their home work, they do the hard problems first and they do the easy staff, because it helps them to counchenteit on the hard staff first. When i have a problem that is very hard i will ask the teacher for help me with it, so that i can do the easy staff by my self.

However, Some people ,like Author Ralph Waldo Emerson think different then the other people. for example when some one has a high school digry they just want to get out of school because if they did it again they will think that they will fail it. Most of the people like to finish something or accomplish something so they work very hard just to get that one thing like the pay check or college digry just to finish the last staff because they don`t want to do it. again because think that it will me waist of time. Some people look only for one thing but not the other. for instens that young man wants to play profashanal basketball, but he not thinks about school or nothing he just wants to play basketball and so when he tries out for a team and he never maid it so he just going to have up because he never grow to be a profeshanal basketball player. It dos it matter what some people do to, to be batter at something that they going to do it again but they will never grow.

Therefore what Author Emerson try to say that people if the have already mastered ,you will never grow. So to say that people can do something that they want to do and they can do it as much time as they want to and they will sicsid in it. Even thou it hard, but some people can do it multiple times. So when they do it again thats haves them another opportunity to do it batter. So to answer the cwesten that Author Ralph Waldo Emerson try to say, no i don`t believe that when people have already mastered in something they cant do it again.

I feel like older student would help the younger student improve there thinking by getting help from the older students.

I feel like the younger student would not be afraid to ask the older students for help. It would help the class communicate to one another. The program would be a success because student helping one another is great seeing them work together as a class having a good time with there class mates. Also the older student are more responsible there also likely to be more trust worthy. They would help the younger student a lot i feel like they would learn more.

Then in a few years later the younger student would come the older student and from there they help them as well too. This program would be a great one it would there student a lot.

1533,75DAA54880C1,"The author Ralph Emerson wrote, '' To be yourself in a world that is constlantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.'' I totally agree with Emerson's statement because be something else is not the most greatest accomplishment that you can do, the most important accomplishment that you can do in this big worl is always be yourself, be humble about everything, be kind with others, and never change the person that you really are.

First, bring humble is one of the most important thing that we always need to have no matter what. Being humble can take you to the top, to be successful in the life. For example, Marisela de Montecristo, is a salvadorian beauty queen, who wob the title of Miss Universe last year and Nuestra Belleza Latina in 2013. Marisela grow up very poor, but when she was 10 years old, she emigrated with her mom to this country looking for a better life, however, when she came here she went to the school, she learned English, and she did graduated in social communication. In 2013 she decided to compete in a reality show that is called '' Nuestra Belleza Latina '' and she won, and with all the money that she won, she decided to founded an own restaurant for her mom in Las Vegas, Nevada. Six years latter, she decided to compite for Miss Universe El Salvador 2018, where she resulted the winner. That year she went to Thailand to compite for the title of Miss Universe. Now she is a famous person and she have her own foundation that helps people in countries around the world like Africa, El Salvador, Mexico, Philipines. Also she is modeling in differents countries like Paris, Spain, and Great Britain, but above all this things that shes is doing, she always still humble. In one interview with Telemundo, she said that being humble is the key of being successful in the live, and I totally agree with her.

Second, be kind with others is something that defined you as a good person, because people love when someone is really interesting in help others. For example, I think that we should be kind with others, help others, because we never know when we going to need help of these people, in addition, being kind is other accomplishment that you can do in this life, and is something that you can feel proud of be.

Third, never change who you really are for something passenger or for something that can not give you happiness, because be yourself is the most important thing that you can do in this big world. For example, my mom told me that being myself is the only thing that can make the difference of me between everyone, she also told me that being gay is not a hindrance to triumphing in my life, because with effort, dedication, and persistence I can do many things in my life, without necessity of change the person who I am.

To finish, be yourself is the only and the best thing you can do in your life. There is not other way to be happy and to demostrated to the world that you don't have to be something else to be successful and to make greatest accomplishment in your life, because the key always is going to be be yourself and be proud the person who you are.",3.5,3.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,3.1,1

Their life is so important to them that they could make own decisions without people tell what to do or ruin their life. People should be wrong about their life not other people life. If they want to help they should talk with the people if want help or not. I know everyone want to help out but sometime they don't want help for other people,friends or their family. They could solve their problem at there own.

For example we don't need people to tell other people how to live their life. They can make their decisions. They a lot people that make bad decision or good decisions in their life.

Most of the time they can be just a sit and write. But sometimes they are really fun to do with your friends. It can be a play and you can have tons of fun doing that. Also it's good for you and your grade so it is a win win.

Most of the time people have good time with their projects and enjoy doing them to score better in their grade. Sometimes we all get projects like building explosive volcano at A science fair. Also projects like going on A field trip to A museum to get info about the World War 2 for Social Studies. Project can be fun when done with A friend or with just A project buddy. You can also do much more with help from A teacher. It can be fun to show your project in front of the class. Some people like to be constant with their grade so that is what they do.

A play can be fun, you can dance, reenact characters, and even just do a reality play. Or you can dress up as a character. Science experiments are really fun to deal with chemicals and to see chemical reactions. It can be fun to play an in interment and to play out loud to the crowd. With your friends and be playing your interment with you. You can do so much with playing an interment and it can be fun at the same time. Playing an interment can be a lot of fun playing for an audience and it can be fun hearing what sound you are creating. Sometimes you can just work with the music and play with a friend and maybe crate a song and play it. You can spend good time with creating a song and playing it with your friends. It can also be fun by doing it and playing in front of the whole class. Going to different places to perform is kinda cool and fun traveling. Music is A lot of fun when you are doing it with A friend or a teacher. I think project can be a great way to show creativity. The more the interment gets played the more the project will get more fun to play with your friends. The music is fun done with a partner as A project.

A concert can be A good place too play your music. A musician can direct the project. They can be really fun and enjoyable when it come to that. The musicians play the music it can be good for the enjoyment of the music that goes into you ear and the project letter can be an A+. You can also do stuff like playing your interment and doing a lot of stuff like that.

For example, if you want to go to college and you do not have money to pay the college, you are going to feel sad because you can not do it, but you have to find a way to solve your problems, you can work and study at the same time, work to get the money to pay the college and then complete your carreer.

To become successul, you have to work hard, do not give up, be positive, solve problems, try your best, and learn something new. Do not forget that success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.",2.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.5,2.8,1
1994,9702AD260172,"In this essay I will talk about how courses and daily life in high school influence the students to guide them and to think in a specific career. When students enter at high school are likely to get interest in anything and I believe their great skills they can show at high school, the support from their parents and think about their own future, is a good idea for students commit to a specific career at young age.

The great skills that a student can show in any course say a lot. There are many students that have differents roles inside the high school. Some of the roles they play are in different environments. There are students that really like Fine Arts, Music Band, Chorus, Act, etc. However, students usually get interest to show skills in differents areas to be a professional like Masters, Lawyers, Bachelors, Doctors, etc. Actually, these careers are more convenient to students but also they need support.

The most students gain total support by their parents and is a big priviledge. Nowdays, there are students that leave the school because they do not have enough support from their parents and this is a awful situation into the society.

Students should be supported to do their job as students and not be concerned about any other stuff beside school. Parents have not to be just the supporters. All the school staff can also support students. The support is very import into society because students are future of the entire wolrd and I know we can make a change at worlwild.

Think in a great and awesome future for us and new generation is amazing. For youngers students is easy to figure out what is necessary and what not. That's why the world needs brilliant minds and leave a legacy that can make bigger differences. More culture, respect to the Rights, more opportunities of jobs, more health to everyone, feed to everyone, and a health and wealthy world are some needs students and people wish to live in good environment to everyone.

In conclusion, students are guided and helped to think in a specific carrer by influnces like cources and lifetime in and out of the high school. The skills that a student can shows is simply awesome, they have great imagination. The support for students is in our hands, students have to be supported. The most important area is focus in their future as the best, doing big differences and doing a legacy. To be young is awesome.",4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.3,1
2550,BD9FE34E4670,"I agree with this statement, because one there's no knowledge without imagination, secondly Albert

Einstein has made many inventions and he has succeeded, and lastly you can be creative with your imagination. one reason, is there is no knowledge without imagination, because your have to be open minded about things. Imagination isnt just a picture in your head. knowledge is something to see, and think about. its not hard to use your imagination its fun, because you can think about anything you want. even if you have to write a essay, then you need to use your imagination as well. Many people invent things, but before they make it they think about what they want to make, and they imagine what what they want. People invented cars, motorcycles, bikes, and skateboards, But before they made all those things they drew it out they took there imagination, and put it on a peace of paper.

My second reason is Albert Einstein invented many things he might of failed on some, but he succeeded on many. He said "" imagination is more important than knowledge"" he made that statement because he used it to make his creations great. It helped him on many things. and it can help us too. For example if your are writing something, you have to use your imagination on it. If you are listening to music, then you are using your imagination as well. Albert Einstein was a very smart man. he had made many things in life, and we use it till now. Even if your thinking about something then your using your imagination too. People had made phones all different types of phones, People have made flip phones, iPhone, and androids they all invented that, and used there minds and creativity to make all that.

My last reason is to be creative with your imagination, I chose this because if your making a book you need to let the reader think, and picture the scene in there mind, or if your reading a book then you have to imagine it in your head instead of just reading it, and doing nothing. Also if your teacher is explaining things to you, then you have to think about what shes saying, and think about what your going to do. for example I once had to make a assay for my teacher, and it was about life bellow water it was pretty hard, and I had to explain what was going on in the ocean. It took a while to make, but I ended up saying that people keep throwing trash in the in the ocean can you imagine how many animals, and creatures are dying every day because of that? I imagined all of it, and people should not throw trash in the ocean. Every time I read a book I saw it all in my head, and it was cool, and fun! Also every time I wanted to draw something, I would have to see it in my head, and see what I should draw. Even if you are trying to make song or some thing, then your have to imagine how the beat is gonna go, and figure out if it sounds good to you. Even if your making a poem then you have to think what rhymes or doesnt rhyme. Also there are doctors that have to see if they can save someone, they have to think and see in there head if they should get this, or that. Everyone uses there imagination there isnt knowledge without imagination. There are kids that get read to, and they imagine whats going on they dont just listen they think about what they hear. That is why I agree with Albert Einstein.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.1,1
1274,61C4FCA012D7,"The school food should change because a lot of students they did not like it and many students feel sick when they eat school food and many students skip their lunch to go and buy food from stores if schools provides the same food for student many students will leave class and learn they will not lean anything for being late in the class and more.

The school lunch should to be healthier for student to eat. Otherwise many students will not go to their class or lunch because they skip class to go buy food. Many students at my school argue that the food should change. And others student say the food should stay the same because they like it and it healthier for them. For example one day at my school students got into agreement saying that they are happy with the school menus that they have those why many students do not skip classes. Other students may not like the idea of changing because they think the new change will worst then they have.

If schools change to healthier food for students many student will be in the class to learn and stop thinking about skiing class to go buy food. For example one of my classmate always goes out to from school during class to buy food and i ask him why he said the school food are not good enough for him and those the problem he skip class to go to buy food. changing school food will be good idea and also bad because same students want same food they have now day but other want change and those where all arguing start. The good way to make students happy about is to keep the one they most like and get ruined of the one they do not like.

Some may argue that changing school menu would be bad idea because the new menu would be something that the students may not like do or not healthier for them. Other people think that many students get sick when they eat school food and many students are not learning and they do not go to classes in time or they skip same periods. In my idea i think changing school menu would be good idea because the menus that school provides are not healthier and same of them are not good for our bodies. The best way to provides healthy food for student is change the menu that most students heat.

To summarize, the main reason to change school menus is there are many students agree with the idea and there same who disagree about changing the school menu. I think good way to solve this problem is they have to keep the menu they already have and students like to eat most. And change for those who agree with the idea. Otherwise it will clause same problem for school principal.",3.5,2.5,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.5,3.2,1
802,3E4B70F8555C,"The benefits of working with a group or working alone. Which do you feel is more beneficial.

In my opinion, I believe working with a group is more beneficial because a group creates different ideas, team work to win the competition, and entertain the audience.

First, each person of the group has a different thoughts and different ideas. They share their ideas to create incurable, different, complete thoughts as a group. Some of the ideas are very difficult to reach the goal, but it is passable to think together and make it happen.

Team work to win the competition is to work together. Each person has to play a different correcter's and roles. Some of them in the group they have to support the main correcter in the stage or back of the stage. Rehearse time to make it inconvenient to be with family members to reach their accomplishment.

Finally, entertaining the audience is most important to each group member. An audience is the people come to enjoy the show, each of the group member are work hard to convince and entertain the audience. Each group member has one leader to follow their roles in specific time to make the show more interact.

I think, the wonderful job can be done working together as a team, developing their ideas and creating entertainment in their performances . And, also, their task is to gives the fans happiness and good time. Team members, families, and teachers will feel proud. I think working with a group it is more joyful.

Most people say the type of traits a person can have define who are as a person, and saying that is ture because the kind of trait you would have or choices can define your character. like for instances let's say you are a very working person your so dedicated to your work that is a trait of dedication or when a person is so nice to you that shows kindness another trait. Even mabybe a person who likes to read that would be a bookworm this is also a trait. Everybody has a trait that they choose.

We choose our owns traits because we think or we know that's the kind of traits we want to have. I am a person who loves to read books, loves food, kind to others, and who can be lazy at most time. A guy name John Lubbock Said "" Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" I'm choosing these traits to be myself and myself only.

The kind of traits i have is kindness, lazyness, bookworm, foodie, and family orident all of these trait are the traits i chocies because it make the person i am today.

Being family orident , i've always loved being around my family because it's gives this joy and happiness just to be around them, plus they make me feel so safe and sound when i'm with my family,all of my traits make up who i am.

Others think it's the opposite because your trait can be choose by the type influnces but i have to disagree on that because people in this world choice the kind of traits they want to have. It dosen't matter on many traits you might have they can still define who you are.

704,36035C063AB3,"Can many things be done if we are always doing? succeed comes with hard work and hard comes with trying, but everyone has different opinions and points of views. Although others believe otherwise, there is always something new to learn in this world, we can influence others for the better, and we can accomplish more if we are always ready to keep doing something.

I believe the world has plenty of things and places we have not yet explored, learned about or have seen before. Everywhere you go, you learn a something new about someone or something; it could be a new culture, places in the world or even a new language, but that is only if you keep doing. For example, I was born in Generic_City and when I came here for the first time everything was new to me. Starting from seeing different faces to a completely new language, I kept trying to learn more and more about the United states because that is how you keep on doing more and not stopping your learning process. When i first went to school here i was afraid and very shy, but that did not stop me from learning the language and sure i learned something new every day because there was so much to explore all around. That is why I believe that there is something new to try and learn everywhere you go. If you encourage yourself to keep doing, you would not believe all the things you can do for yourself. Which those things sometimes can help you improve yourself and the way you view different things as well.

If you keep doing and learning more, you can absolutely influence others for the better. You can teach others from the mistakes you have made from trying new things and from all the experiences you have had before as well. Someone that I look up to as my role model is my older sister, because she taught me how to be the strong young women I am today. She influenced me for the better, because of what she has been through before me. One thing she taught me that was very important to me is to not give up on my goals and my mindset from the beginning. She once told me that people will doubt me no matter who they are, and one of those people was my mother. My mom taught that my sister and I would not even get to college, but here I am as a junior in high school and my sister about to graduate college. A day never went by without my sister reminding me of how strong and independent I can be if i keep trying and keep learning because the world is full of things to learn from, good or bad. My sister had to keep learning and was always trying to do something new, because she new she could influence me for the better so i could learn from her mistakes. There is always gonna be someone out there with advice for you and to influence you for the better, but if you keep learning and trying nothing is impossible. Influencing others can be very important, mostly for the younger generation. They look up to us now and it should be an honor to show them the rights from the wrongs but that is only possible if you try to have a good mindset of always wanting to be a better person and knowing what you want. Never stop trying to learn new things because there will always be something out there to learn from and to look at it from a different point of view.

Accomplishing a goal can be very hard sometimes and even makes you wanna give up but that is something you should not do. If you are always doing and trying new things you can accomplish so much more than you would ever imagine you could. My goal was to learn English, go to school, and graduate all to prove my parents and my older sister i could. I accomplished part of my goals so far and that makes me feel very proud of myself because i feel like i am slowly accomplishing my goals in a short period of time. When i was younger and until now i have always liked books and that is something that helped me learn English and to improve my learning techniques in school as well. I have not yet graduated but that is a goal that i am maintaining and that i know i will accomplish soon, but the only way that will happen is if i keep doing and learning more every time i possibly can. You may have people who doubt you or who do not want to see you succeed but you should never let them control your mindset and the way you do things. A positive mindset always comes with a positive outcome, and always surround yourself with good people because we are here to make good things happen to each other. But keeping your mind open to new things will always help you learn more everyday and have new experiences too.

You just need to believe in yourself and understand that there is so much more out there that you could not know about, and that it is always good to encourage yourself to go out there and try things you have never tried before. always influence others for the better and accomplish all your goals no matter how hard it can get, because at the end of the day every good thing you do will absolutely pay off later on when you least expect it or see it coming. In conclusion I believe Thomas Jefferson's quote is very true because of all the wonderful things we can learn, experiences we can have, and things we can accomplish with time if we keep on doing.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.4,1

prompt: School program

""Life in high school"". In high school to ca be graduate and learn how the new life is in here, and learn a lot of things to adapted or to fit to the new language and the new people what did I say new here is another world, new people new language that is why I'm here, I came from to my native country. To learn English and speak like a normal person like I speak Spanish, speak bout same without of problems. I'm going to take position on myself to spoken in this introduction, things did i most enjoy in high school is having the opportunity to study here in the United State. And also learn a new language I'm so thanks full for all those opportunities.

All of the things did happen on my life was not easy, and also I remember when my cousin speak English like a normal language and he also came from where came from and i remember did i said i want to spoke like you i was so impressed and how he can speak English like a normal person here in the U.S, because in that time I did not any English at all. When was my time to get in high school begin all this things did i was want for a long time. first day I was so nerviest but at the same time exerted because I came in with my mind in what I'm want and what I love was and is learn English and spoke like normal.

Generic_School give the opportunity at the students graduate on three years, except at the normal traditional four, let me tell you why I take three years except at the normal four cause my age I'm almost getting on (21) at the date to graduate for example, if I'm taking the four years of high school when the people have more then 21, they kicking you off the school

I thing was I good idea taking just the three years to can be graduate on time.

In addition all what has to happen to can be graduate is taking all of the classes did I need it to get the credits. making or taking classes on summer school maybe night school to graduate on time is hard process to graduate in three year but helps a lot to the people who work after school or another thing that probably they has to do, to graduate without credits missing. And here I am in my last year of high school I'm a senior I feel good can be say this is my last year here and all this help me for the program what they made for us to graduate in three years that helps me at all.

In conclusion; I enjoy the must time in high school I know was and is a big way to run was not easy but also no difficult when we want just put in your mind what you want and if you want you can this is my lemma don't give up at the last moment we can cause if you want you can nothing is impossible in this life don't lust the time because the time is like gold I know all this no to much relate about the prompt but I'm know did I doing well believe in yourself. one of the things did I'm thinking about what I going to do after school is going directly at collage don't lust the time did I win.

1527,759E0659FF69,"A city council is debating the adoption of a 10pm weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers. does curfew help teenagers or not help teenagers. Curfew is a bad idea because curfew do not help teenagers on weekday and also the weekends. My tops three reasons are stay out more, sink in/out the house, and they can get in trouble.

When teenagers stay out more it because they want hang more with their friends. My friends and i hang out and we smoke. My curfew was 11pm and i didn't check the time then i know that it was past my curfew i ask my one of my friend if he can give me a ride home i got my house keys. When my friends drop me off at my house and i open door of my house than i saw my parents sleeping and the next day my mom ask if i came back to the house at my curfew and i said yes and i got always with it.

Teenagers also sink in/out of the house. Some may say that curfew help teenagers to be home on time. They are wrong because most teenagers sink out of their bed room window. One night around four in the morning i was sleep and then i heard lot of noise. I got up from my bed and i saw my sister sink in from my bed room window and so help her to get in my room but around that time we are sharing my room because we had a room met. We both went back to bed and i told we will talk about this in the morning. In the morning i ask her why she sink out the room and she said that she need to think things over, she could't sleep, and she want go outside. I told her what happened if someone just take you and then what happened. She said well no one did and i told yeah thank god. We didn't our parents.

Most teenagers can get in trouble with their parents. When teenagers get in trouble it mostly with their parents because most parents are strict. When parents are strict it that they want what best for their children than they had. When teenagers are in trouble the person they go running to is their parents because they know they something bad and now they need help for it. On a weekend my friends and i are doing weed in one of my friend basement and her parents catch us doing weed and her parents told my parents. When i got home my parents were in the table and we all talk. My parents told me to stop doing weed so i did but few years later i was doing weed again and again they found out somehow. We talk about it now i stop doing weed for good.

Curfew is a bad idea on a weekday and weekends. Curfew do not help teenagers on weekdays and weekends because they can stay out more, sink in/out the house, and they can in trouble. This are all my tops three reasons.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,1
2575,BF580042A644,"The city council is debating on having curfews for teenagers, weekdays they have until 10 p. m and on the weekends they have until midnight. This is for the teenagers to be safe and not be out late because something could happen to them if they are out on the streets at night. This rule would be an outstanding one because they can cause less trouble and they can stay out of trouble at the same time. This rule won't interfere with young peoples life, it would keep them safe at home and their parents don't have to worry about them doing anything bad. The teenagers can be talking to their friends, loved ones, and family on their phone or be playing with them on PlayStation or Xbox.

My first reason why I think they should the adopt the curfew rule is because it keeps them at home and keeps them safe. For an example, if your teenager stays home and doesn't go out passed his curfew then he or she won't get hurt or even worse shot by a dangerous person . If the city council adopt the curfew rule they can prevent your son or daughter from getting beat up or getting shot . This rule can prevent anything dangerous happening to your son or daughter, this will keep them inside and they can study, catch up on miscomplete assignments , and do homework. You won't have to worry about them that much because you know they are safe at home and won't try to get you in a serious problem. It's also your job as parents to keep watch out on your son or daughter because they can try sneaking out. The city council can't really do anything about your teenager sneaking out from your house so you are responsible for watching your kid.

My second reason why I think the city council should adopt the curfew rule is to keep your teenager from breaking the law and to keep them from doing horrible things. To demonstrate, If your teenager is not out on the street then he or she can be drawing or painting on paper instead of doing graffiti on building or walls . This could prevent teenagers from getting in trouble and prevent people from cleaning up the teenagers own mess. If you have talent to draw amazing objects then try showing it in school or on your personal items and not on the cities property. I suggest buying a ton of paper or objects that you can paint on instead of doing graffiti on buildings or walls own from the city council. If your teenager is caught doing this , he or she is gonna be in a serious problem and they will have to clean it.

My final reason why I think it's important to have a curfew rule is because this will prevent your teenager from doing illegal things such as drinking or doing drugs. We don't know what our kid could be doing passed curfew so I think we need this curfew so we can make sure they are not doing anything illegal. This keeps our kid safe and also out of trouble because its horrible to be drinking and doing drugs. For an example ,If your teenager was caught doing illegal things and doing it passed curfew , it would be extremely terrible and your teenager would be in a whole lot of trouble. This is why having a curfew and checking on your kids room once in awhile will help you prevent this from happening and also keep your teenager from having a black out, crashing or a overdose. If your teenager has some bad friends, tell your kid to stop talking to them because they might try forcing him or her to do something that they do not want to do. Instead of doing those things , just talk to your loved ones, friends, and family on the phone or play with them on PlayStation or Xbox.

As a result, having a curfew on weekdays and weekends is important because this could prevent anything from happening to your teenager. I do not think they interfere with young peoples life but keep them safe from anything happening to them , keep them from breaking the laws and getting in trouble by the police .My three main reasons from having a curfew were to keep them from doing anything illegal, to keep them from getting hurt or killed,

to keep them from doing graffiti on buildings and walls, and makes the parent communicate with the teenager and see what they are doing .One last important thing is to always communicate with your teenager because they want your help but deep down they won't ask for it , so it's important to check up on them once an awhile and see how they are doing.

This is why I think the city council should adopt the curfew rule . The curfew rule is an outstanding rule and I think more city councils should adopt it as well.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.1,1

First having a career in a young age,start work (having a job) and living by yourself. its like middle school and high school switch around youre pranging to live your life as adult instead living your life as teenage. At that age no one knows how to spend money or mange too. money is like water you have then spend it, all gone.

Then the other choice not having a career in a young age,living their life to the fullness plus spending time with family and friends. you dont have to worry so much about paying bills and other things. Your family will support you no matter what happen,you could go out with friend. At this point you could spend more time on studying mostly importation on yourself.

436,20E2B07931F3,"Once in a while we all have been heard a phrase; ""TRY, TRY, UNTIL YOU SUCCED"". We all have been gone through failing, at some part of our lives. But we never give up and we do our best. And at the end we get more of it. Yes we accomplish more if we are always doing something. There are few people who don't agree to this statement. They say doing something more will not let you do other work. But rather than seating ideal, we should always try new things around. Trying new things can give new experience. Also, you can get better at things. And, moreover it also makes you strong. Rather than seating ideal, doing nothing; we should always keep on trying new things.

We humans always have dreams of doing things like: Sports, Cooking, Adventure activities, getting into music, dance, and many more. Doing something and trying out new things will always give you new experience. I wanted to learn guitar from my childhood but, it was not possible when i was in school. During my last summer break i joined guitar classes. It was next level experience to me. I learned so many new things which i never knew about guitar. There, i also met new people and made new friends. Meeting new people and knowing interesting facts about their lives is also a new experience.

On the other hand their are some people who says trying new things don't give you experience, and it also wastes your time. But if we want to at least full fill our dreams then we have to keep on working hard.

There are few people who argue; doing same things everyday won't give you anything and you will also not able to focus on other things. But that's not true. Doing same thing again and again can make you better and you can be best in the future. let's just talk about me when i joined my guitar classes. On the very first day i didn't knew nothing about guitar. Their were lots of things like: cords, tunes, vocal. This all were like a big giant algebra equation which were kept in front of me, in which i didn't even knew how to solve for x. I knew a little bit of knowledge how to play with guitar string, but i never knew much things in details. On the very first day when i went to my guitar class i was not really good. But after continuing playing for a month i actually started improving at that. And today i'm really good at playing guitar.

There are many individual who says that trying new things is a fail. And later it demotivates you and make you feel depressed and upset. Many of us our not really good at things. We fail at many things at first. In this situation many of us give up and don't try to take a second chance. But do we actually know that failure is the biggest key to success and it also teaches you many lesson. I'm not really great student who can Handel math. I failed in algebra1 in my 9th. Every test, every quiz, i used to get D or either F. But failing at same things again and again until i started getting good grades thought me so many new things. And it also made me more stronger. Failing makes you more stronger so that in future also you can fight with it.

In conclusion seating ideal will never make you succeed. Trying new things is a opportunity to learn new things and explore things around you.                       ",3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,1
223,10BE9BFD7D41,"the British naturalist and politician John Lubbock wrote, "" your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.""

I disagree with that because our character formed by influences beyond our control, for example we all leaned whats right or wrong, let's take a babies for example the leaned for people all around them, by seeing what they do for example how they speak, how they walk and how they dress. the only they can not be influences by other people if their parent stop then from doing all those things. take me for example as a baby grow up speaking french because thats that the Language. when I moves to my grandma place she speak Spanish with me so now I speak Spanish, and french I could never speak those languages if I was not influence by those around me.

I get the part that said we choose our own character trait because we all now if something worn or not we can choose to the wrong thing or the right thing it up to us at this point for example some ask you what you what to be in the future now it you choose to make even tho you have a choose there is a 50/50 present you will follow the same path as some in your life that influences you. we all are influences by something or someone an example some teen want to be raper because there is someone around their that one or they want to be a basketball player because the know a basketball player they think he or she is cool. if you disagree with me, ask yourself, how did I become who I'm today? Was I influence by someone? Or did I choose to become who I'm?

2854,CF45352F8424,"Do you think positive attitude is a key that everyone need in order to be a successful person in life? In my essay I will talk about positive attitude, if it is important or not. In my opinion attitude should be always positive, because it can help you to succeed in work, can encourage people to do their best, even if what they have to do is hard to do it, and it can be a great tool in order to succeed in relationships, and believed in yourself.

When I was working in Mango Paradise, my boss was a really bitter person, that was always angry with everyone in the work, but I was one person that I didn't care about his bad attitude toward us, I was always with a big smile, perhap how he treated us. There was one day that he had a bad day, because one member of his family was in the hospital, and was very delicate, he was an a mood that did not look like he was the same one, he was sad, he was devastated, and worried, because the person that was in the hospital was his wife, she had cancer. So, that same day I asked him if we may talk, he said "" Yes"", I just wanted to talk with him and tell him that perhap everything, we were there to support him in everything he needed. Unfortunate, his wife pass away, and as I said to him, we were there all the time supporting him, we were there with a positive attitude telling him, that everything will be okay, that his wife is gonna be in a better place where can rest in peace, where she will not suffer more. He was so thankful with us because how we supported him in that bad moments that wanted to increase our salary, many of us accepted, but many others not. He really change since that days, that many of us, we are still working there, and earning more money than we regurlarly earned.

In every human life, there is always a hard problem, that make us to give up, but there is also a person with a positive attitude that makes us to get up, and continue with our life. There was a time in my family where we had a problem of money, my father got fired on his work, we almost lose the house where we were living, because we did not paid the rent in almost four months. My father was devastated, he was looking for a job amost for three months, and he could not find any job to pay the rent, so we would not lose the house. As every wife do, my mom came to him and said ""Do not worry sweetheart, we can get out of this problem as we always do, I am here to support you"". My father almost immediately changed his attitude, he gave to my mom a big smile and said to her "" Thanks babe to be always with me, and for trust on me"", he get up take the keys of the car, and went out to look for another job. He found a new job where he earn a little bit more than his previous job, so our money's problem disappear.

Believe in yourself not always is easy, some times we though that is difficult to understand yourself, but there is always a lovely person that help you to believed in how strong you are, and to see all the thing that you are capable to do. When I was in 10 grade, I had an algebra teacher that was always telling us that we had to believed more in ourselves, sometimes we did not do what she asked us to do, because we did not understand, many of us were disappointed of ourselves, because we didn't even try to do it. In the first quater many of us in our class period failed. We though that our score would never change. After that many student changed their attitude, but it was not because we wanted. It was because our teacher talked with us, and made us to believe that we can do anything that we want to do. Some time later many of us had changed, as we changed, we saw that our teacher changed too. The second quater passed, and the students were happy because their score in the algebra class, many students's score were from 50 to 90, it happened because all us changed our attitude in different manners. We paid more attention as we should since the beginning of the year, we started to believe in us, we started to do things even if we didn't know how to do it. Until this moment I am thankful with my teacher, because of her, we changed to a better score, because of her we believe more in ourselves, she just wanted our best, but sometimes we made her get angry, because we did not believed in ourselves. We changed, all of us did, and she became for me the most good person as a teacher and as a friend, she was always supporting us, and teaching us. That is why until this moment she is one of my favorite teacher, and I think that for my other classmates she is too. For that experience that I had, I think that possitive attitude is something extremely important in every human life.

Our attitude has to be always positive, even in the worst moment of our life.

Some people think that a person should have a positive attitude just during a very important moment, or in happy moments, this is not correct, they all are wrong, we need to have a possitive attitude always in order to succeed in life, and to be happy.

3135,DD265EC28AEB,"Now a days schools are finding new ways to use cell phones for educational purposes. Schools and teachers want to find new ways to educate students through cell phones since every child is attracted to them. But with schools trying to find ways that works, it does have its negative effects to it. The effects with using cell phones in classroom for educational purposes is that many students will end up getting off tasks, no more hands on learning, and they will start to relying too much on their cell phones. With cell phones being use for educational purpose, it has its negative effects to it and will affect student's learning in the process.

As cell phones are being use for educational purposes, a negative effect to this idea is that students will not focus or get off task in their classes. If they use cell phones in classroom for a method to educate people, students with tend to get distracted on their phones and not learn what they are suppose to teach. Students will also end up dozing off and start to listen to music or even end up playing games on their phones and not focus on what's being taught. Also with social media being so big now a days students will focus more on texting friends or being on their Snapchat, Instagram, or even Twitter rather than focusing on what teacher is showing the classroom. With cell phones being use in classroom, students will end up getting more distracted and off task than when you do not use cell phones in the classroom to teach. The next paragraph will talk about another reason why using cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes has its negative effect.

As cell phones are being use for educational purposes, a negative effect to this idea is that there is no more hands on learning for students. If school are using cell phones as a method to teach people, the students are not getting the hands on learning that they should get. Back then before everyone had a cell phone the way they were taught was with the step by step on doing the work and trying to understand how you ended up doing the work. But if they use cell phones in the classrooms the students would not be getting the step by step understanding of the work, rather than they doing it on the phones and just getting the answers. With schools using phones in the classroom the students would not be getting the same knowledge and understanding to specific problems and work than those who learn the step by step learning to the problems. In the next paragraph we will see another reason why using cell phones for educational purposes has a negative effect in the classrooms.

As cell phones are being use for educational purposes, a negative effect to this idea is that students will end up relying too much on their cell phones and technology to get the work done. As the more classroom or schools end up using cell phones for educational purposes the students will end up relying on their phone to get the work done for them and not try to do it theresleves. For example imagine students cell phones end up not working and they only used their cell phones to get the work done, what are they going to do now if they only use their phone to do the work and they did not learn the material on their own. With schools using phones as a way of teaching it with effect the students ways of learning and will start to rely on his/her phone in the later future to get their stuff done. In the last paragraph it will concluded the paper and sum up everything about the paper.

In conclusion if more and more schools end up using cell phones for educational purposes they will make more students get distracted during class, not have the hands on learning they should have, and also they will start to rely on their cell phones more for the work rather than them trying to do the work them self. With cell phones trying to be used as a method of learning, it will end up not giving the students the education they need but rather them showing a way to get the work done quicker without all the extra work that should be done. So schools should stick with the methods they have now and not try to add cell phones as another method of teaching these students. ",3.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.4,1
2333,AD5F7E8C127F,"It is a good idea for students to finish High School in three years? many students graduated from high school in a very short period. But, do you know if the student knows what he/she needs to know?. In some cases students didn't remenber something from high school. Many students forget everything that they learned when is Summer or when they stop to go to the school, in a very short time. It depend from the knowledge of a students if he/she can take everything on his/her heat. May be more time led the students to know what they want to do after the High School, and have elective classes can help the students to be a good worker in the future because they are more creative.

Depend from the knowledge of the student if he/she can take everything on his/her heat because some students have the capacity to learn a lot without forgered and other not, possibly they have apathy in some classes or they are more interested in other things since in some school districts offer progams that can contein clases that students don't want to learn. But, it can be very helpfull for the students that want to graduate so fast from the high school becuse may be they want to work without a interuption from high school's things or the want to go the colledge without they had a lot of time in high school. Also, some students think that have the capacity to graduate from high school in a short time and other prefert to graduate with the normal years because some students want to have the advanced diploma that can give you goods oprtunities.

May be more time led the students to know what they want to do after high school because some students graduated so fast that they didn't thing correcly what they want to be or what to do after the high, someway you have do to something in your life that can help you to live ecconimicaly between the world. For example, you are graduate today but in a week or a month you are doing nothing because you don't know what you want to do but you need something with your life. Also, if you want to graduate so fast from high school you need a plan like; i'll work after high school because i need money, or i want to study more because i think i need to know more and i want in my future. For example: the people who work after high school is the people that knows whar they want without matter the time that they took in the high school and the people who still stiding is because they arenot ready to know what they want or they still studing for a carrer.

Have elective classes can help the students to be a good worker in the future because they are more creative, and elective clasess led the students to learnd new things that can help them in the future and in their usually life. For example: if they take an art class they will be more creative, if they take a music art they can have their own record. Also , elective class give more oportunities that a progam that conteins the usually class and borred. Finally, summer is a good time to take a break from high school and you have the oportunity to be in a class

Online if it's difficult for you to remenber something during that time.

In conclusion, some programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years are good for the students who knows what they want to do after the high schools like if they want to work or if they will still studing. Also take a little bit time to graduate is not to bad because you never will to know what new things can you learn in the elapse of the time you keep have the oportunity to think more in what to do in the future. Also, if you have the capacity to remenber things for a log time is not too bad the idea to graduate in three years. The only thing that a student need to know is nake a plan for the future with clear ideas and be sure in what he/she wants.",3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.4,1
3495,EEDF62EFA5D7,"Thomas Jefferson Prompt

Thomas Jefferson once said, Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Jefferson wanted the world to become more active in life whether if it is a physical.

Being active has many positives. Activity in society can help people reach their goals, help society, live life to the fullest, feel good and use time wisely. In this world people have big reasons to have activity life for example, they need one work where maybe all the time they are move for this reasons and more I think that the people need one activity life.

Small actions like recycling or participating in community this help to disperse a good life for you and for the other people because people look that you have one purpose in the life. The life is hard, you need activity, you need to learn new things all the time, and never you be a inactive person because if you are a inactive person you not have good reason for live in this world.

Inactivity is not good for your dreams or goals in the life because if you have one dream about buy a sport car, the car is not coming if you not work hard to take the money for the sport car. Nothing coming so easy you need effort, and dedication the inactivity not help you, the essence of the life is to crate good reason of live and work for yours dreams and goals.

The idle person is a person how not have activity, That person maybe not have dreams or goals or maybe your dream is be idle, but the poin is that a idle person not have reasons for the society, not have support for your community, and he or she is lost in the life. For a idle all is for tomorrow not take actions today, not take effort and if make this person not put the one hundred percent only put five percent. Remember you need put effort to your activitys in the work, school, sports and your life all need effort.

1228,5F467A8F3896,"What are people going do if they find themselves in a situation of danger because of meting the wrong person on social media? No body would like the idea of being on danger but if we do not know how to manege social media we all are in danger. What are people going to do if they find themselves all alone because they did not take the chance of meting someone new, o because they did not enjoy the little moments whit their family? How could someone think that human communication is not necessary? People would not have the chance of having a nice chat whit their family or friends. Although some people say that the limitation of human contact due the use of technology has a positive effect because it helps people whit communication problems interact whit other people due social media, actually the limitation of human contact due the use of technology has many negative effects because people miss priceless moments whit their family and friends and there is a high risk of meting someone dangerous on social media.

People say that the limitation of human contact due the use of technology has a positive effect. This is because they think that it helps people whit communication problems interact whit others due social media. Many studies have showed that social media is very helpful for those people that are insecure of themselves to interact whit others not just from their city but whit people from different places in the world. Technology is advancing, and it is trying to help people whit different needs. In this case technology allows people from everywhere to communicate whit others does not matter the place they are.

It is a privilege for the people that are far away from their families. It is also a way that people use to get away from having uncomfortable chats whit people from their surroundings.

However the limitation of human contact due the use of technology has many negative effects. Because people miss the opportunity of having nice moments whit their family,

their families start to break apart. That's the case of my cousin's family. they were a beautiful family but everything went apart because my cousin's wife spent most of her time on Facebook, where she found a random guy, so she left my cousin whit their three daughters and one son. social media can destroy families and relationships in seconds, but is our duty to enjoy our time whit the people that we love because we show the love that we feel for them and communication by technology can never do that. We do not know if one day the people we love are going to leave, but if they leave we are going to keep those priceless memories on our heart. Family is everything and we should never let anything get us apart from it.

Even if social media allows people from everywhere interact whit each other; there is a high risk of met whit someone dangerous. There are many cases where young ladies have being abducted.

This happen when young ladies decide to met boys from social media that result not being what they thought but kidnappers. Those kidnappers sale the young ladies, and this poor girls are forced to give up on themselves and work as prostitutes.

All of this could be avoided if we start to know better about the people near us instead of trying to met someone that we dont know anything about . It's important to recognize that social media have benefits if we know how to use it correctly, but we need to be careful because we have to know other people better before trusting them, and it is even better if we already have had a chat in person whit those people.

In conclusion the world is constantly changing and technology is an important factor in actuality, but in those cases where technology is used incorrectly many people can get damaged. Technology is not a need but is a benefit, and if we are allowed to use it, we should do it whit responsibility and not depend from it. In spit of the fact some people believe that technology is more than necessary, and that there is no need of human interaction because it helps people with communication problems, in truth the limitation of human contact due the use of technology has just negative effects because we can experience more than one danger; like losing our family or being forced to a prostitute. Communication in person is necessary, there is no better way of live our life than enjoying the time whit our family, the little chats and of curs taking the opportunity of get to know better each one near us. A computer or a phone can never transmit our feelings, and if people want to express themselves they do not have to be trapped on technology.            ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,1
3309,E54E238C6DDB,"I would think that some student's would stay home so they can catch up on things they need but some stay so they can get the help they really need. For example if a parent see's his child struggling they could ask their child and be like do you need help or what do you want us to do to help you. I'm pretty sure that some students are gonna take this opportunity, and take online classes or get the help they need from a teacher or someone they know who can help them. The real reason that I think they will do it is because they would want to graduate from school so they can get the diploma and be happy that they did it with the help of a parent. Yes, I do believe that student's would benefit with taking classes at home or by online classes with a video conferencing. Student's should be grateful that some school's are giving them the opportunity to take some classes at home or even with a teacher they can video chat with and they can help them too. If it wasn't for the school who was giving us the privilege do take this opportunity for the help then we wouldn't be passing anything or getting the help we need. For example, if a student goes to the school and tell's them hey i'm having trouble getting this subject i know for sure the teacher are gonna give them a choice to pick if they want help or take online classes at home with like a teacher who's helping them. Another reason kids ask for help is because they probably ask at home and sometimes's parent's dont have the time to help them cause they are tired from work or they just tell them to ask someone else and then they don't get the help they need. For some student's it's easy for them but for some it isn't easy so some students can help each other so they can understand it. For other reason's it's better for kids to try on there own first and then if they still dont get it then they ask for the help or ask the teacher for help at the same time.

Ive also been through that to where I want to succead at something that I want to achieve and theres failure down the road. Once I failed I told myself to be positve about it and not just give up or get stressed about it and know that I needed to work harder at it.

There are people who want to have succes but forget that its not that easy. People have to remember that it takes time and to have patience,and stay positive. Its not easy because that person has to work hard and show effort but even after showing and doing all those things there still can be failure. When somebody fails its better to think about what can be down next time and to try harder after the first try.

Anybody could lose confidence or the energy after they keep failing but he or she forgets to see what can be down better next time. After that to check what has gone wrong and not lose confidence because eveybody has the potential to do anythung. Failure will always be there but it plays an important role for that person to remember that nobodys perfect and that theres always mistakes. The important part is to keep trying and to fix that mistake and to keep that energy up and confidence that it can be done its mot impossible.

I've also been through this to where i have a big dream and i chase after it and I think its easy but then i realized it was starting to get harder. After i tried so hard to keep working and trying i lost confidence after i kept failing again,and again. Its better to stay positive because people might say that i cant do it or many things that can cause me to lose confidence. But i choose to stay posive because i realized nobody is perfect even artist,singers,and many other things that people wanted to be because they also had mistakes and had to try harder next time. I realized after failing there were improvements better then the last time i tried and it kept happining becuase i tried harder each time but eventually i got there. Its best to know that in order to have success theres failure but it has to movitate to try harder next time and then eventually when someone works hard enough they have success.

I have, and I say we as young adult should pace ourselfs and not rush this important life decision so early. Because that decision de the person and the time, not important for take one career. Each young person has a decision to purse a career or not because it is optional.

First of all I disagree whit this idea, because young students are more like to listen what adults tell them to chose. That ends up on kinds chosen careers they dont want or like and in the long run it takes away their Dreams, money, and time. The kinds need more inspiration for that in future they take one career like: doctor, arquitec, teacher, and other carriers is good have one inspiration. Is good have persons that support in every time like Mom, family or dad. Because much young not listen the adult or not have support in the family for that reason they do not pursue a career.

Secondly us young adults need to expand our knowledge in the work field. Like for example we need to watch videos and have people already working their to explain How they work and ward they do. It would be a good idea to have two examples of people: a person who has ready finished his career and has work and money and the other, who does not finish his studies and asks for money in the street. Is good what a young thing in her future the difficult is life outside working in the hot or cold not is nathing essy.

Everybody have that thing in her future, on good future for the family, wife, sons, daughter. Is good have idea in the High school that like you. Because you like draw you take the career arquitec is good idea. The people inspired draw like building, the natural place everything is good. The people like arquitec to created building in Dubai is very nice I don't no but is beautiful in only imagination. Much person no have idea the important is the study in the life.

Much young take to abandon the high school and decision working because no everybody have east opportunity other people need more working because not have more family.

1814,88ECDCC89475,"Individuality

I am agree to be independent in a world is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment, because you can feel proud of yourself. Independent means that you have the control of the you doing, also signify not looking to others for one's opinions or for guidance in conduct. I think that when you decide make the things for yourself is because you are ready to confront the different situations that the life give you.

The individuality is one that pursues a markedly independent course in thought or action. That means that your actions have influence in you, all that you doing have a purpose.

For example, when you want something but is spend, you work hard for it, and can get it. This going to make you happy because just you know how you worked for buy it.

Be yourself in the world is not simple, need to have good thoughts, these are the key for the most big accomplishment. For example, when someone tell you do this, you need to think about it, and decide it is good or not , if is something bad that going to affect you. Some people no want that you win or protrude in the life, or not believe that you can do. But you need have the capacity to show them, that you can and not need help for obtain it.

Accomplishment is the quality or ability, the result of something. Make big accomplishment for yourself, teach you that you can do all that you want, but only if you believe and have trust in you. Sometimes we don't something that we want for fear, because think that the result not going to be favorable or how you thoughts. For example, sometimes many opportunities came for your life, and you never accept. But when you take the decisions of do, you see that is possible. Now know that you are able to do anything that you want.

In my conclusion be yourself in the world is good, because your learn about the life, also to do things that you not believe possible. I think that good thoughts can make you successful. Also I think that do all individuality is not easy, but not impossible. The biggest accomplishment only are caused when you do things for yourself.

If you mess up and make a mistake you will learn not to do it again. It's better if you make mistakes insted of being perfect because you can't learn and better yourself. We all make mistakes once in a while that's why we learn from them. You shouldn't let your mistakes hold you down. You should let your mistakes better you. Don't try to be perfect. If you do you will just end up never learning from an experince. When you make a mistake, adapt to how you can fix it and don't make that same mistake. This is one of the reasons why a problem is a chance for you to do better. Another reason is You learn not to make the same mistake twice.

You make a mistake and you learn from it. It's fine if you make another mistake just don't makr the same mistake again. If you make the same mistake twice you could get in trouble. When you make a mistake and learn from it you grow. Don't take a mistake as a flaw. You become wiser from a mistake. You become a better and smarter person. This is why a problem is a chance for you to do better.

The last reason is you improve yourself. You let yourself learn more instead of feeling like you can't come back after that mistake. Your mistakes become positive because you learn so much. Mistakes were never meant to be flaws. They werer always meant to be learnd from. Mistakes help you become a better person by learning from them.

2171,A22BC15DDB95,"To conserve energy and resources, some businesses have adopted four-day work week, with each day consisted of ten hours. Like other places, the energy conservation in the school is also important. To have four-day school with additional two hours, is not a good idea due many problems.

Having four-day school is a good idea, because of some advantages. By having three days off from school student will have more time to do other things such as, they can spend more time on job, sports, picnics, other courses, etc. The students will have more time to relax and the students will be mentally well prepared for coming work days. Due to this, we can also conserve large amount of energy and other resources.

On the other hand, it also has a lot of disadvantages. By having two additional hours every day the student will be tired and they have to do more work every day. As a result, the students will not able to pay attention toward learning. When you are tired you can not able to pay full attention toward studies, due to which this is useless because students will not able to learning anything. This will also effect their grades. The students that do part time job they will face problem in doing that. The students who are willing to participate in extra curriculum activities, they will not able to participate in it. These are the reason that makes it a bad idea.

Four-day work week have more disadvantages. To make education and studies wealthy, we should not adopt it because it makes the studies and learning worthless. That is why having f our-day work week is a bad idea.                                    ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.3,1

Also, working alone can be more beneficial because you can work at your own pace. Working at your own pace is very important, you will not make mistakes and if you do it is totally fine because that is where we learn from. You may be the type of person that likes working little by little every night instead of doing it all at once. You will not have people over your house horse playing instead of helping you out and working with you on your project. When working alone you do not have to worry about all these concerns because you will be the only responsible one for your own work.

Working alone is more beneficial and can be very helping, it will prepare you for the real world. When working alone you may write or put what you think is correct, your friends will not be there to tell you that you are incorrect. You might be a independent person and prefer to work by yourself. You do not have to worry about someone rushing you because you should know when the due date is. While working alone you just have to worry about you, and finishing your work of course.

Although, others may think it is more beneficial working with a group. Working with a group can bring a lot of distractions. Research determined that when it comes to group projects people complain and prefer to work independently. Also, why would you want to work with others if you do not know if they are in the same level as you. When working with a group you have to check up on your group members to see if they finished there part of the project, if they are not responsible enough to finish it themselves you have to fill in for them because it is a group project and project grade.

3789,FAA9FC1B315B,"In my personal opinion when some schools offer distance learning as an option for student to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing I mostly disagree. Its not because I am attending a public high school. There are reasons why I mostly disagree about this situation.

One of the reasons why I disagree is because this might hurt the students communication skills.

when you have classes online you are not at the school you are home taking this class so you basically don't associate with anyone except your teacher now since i have never took a online class i wouldn't be able to tell if its better to not know no one or to associate with anyone but personally I just dont't thing it's good for students to attend online school if you are someone that like to work with people and not just your teacher. Other students also might be able to understand some stuff that you don't understand and that they should be able to help you. They won't be able to help you if you not there with them.

The second reason why I disagree and I really don't think that online schools is not beneficial is that it hurts your participation skills too. Here in school we do so much activities connected to things we are learning and it helps very much because if you do activities connected to the things we are learning it gets stuck in your mind. Its also better to ask questions and to understand better. There might be some stuff that you didn't understand face to face with your teacher its better to ask them like that and understand like that instead of emailing them or contacting them through different thing.

Also the teacher might not respond as soon as possible and that might be a problem and affect your grade and thats why its better to talk to your teacher face to face and deal with understanding face to face that's my second opinion.

My last and final reason is that you might get lazy and miss classes since you take it at your home . That might affect your grade too which is very risky if you're not a productive and committed person to your education online class is not for you. For example me personally it will not be good for me because I am a very lazy person i am pretty sure I

will miss classes either by sleeping in or some other unexeptalbe reasons . But also there are people that are very organized and careful people out here that can risk this for those kind of people online classes are good and they can take it because thy are committed to Finnish there education in a very careful way.

Those are my good reason why i don't agree with online classes it's a good thing that schools offer distance learning as an option for students if you have a good reason why you don't actually go to the school but personally i dont agree with this situation.

The students required of many classes to accomplish their knowledge, but some people think that students need to take a music, drama,or an art class because:

I think that students will need those classes to graduate. To get school diploma students will have to accomplish some classes like music,drama,or an art class. they should use those classes for distraction their mind to the other classes for examples math, history and science class then, they will get relaxation. Also, I think that some people wants the students take those classes because those classes represent happiness, peace and an individual talent that every person have. but some people get frustrated that they don not have any talent like sing, act or draw. Some people want that the students take those classes because they need to develop their mind in something productive for the society and for them. No think in bad things or bad actions.

Also,I think that some people think that students should be take a music,drama,or art class because students have the potential to protrude in the great music,drama and art world. To prove to the society the capacity that they may have and that they are the future. They will replace the people that do music drama and art in our present for example artists,painters and others.

I think that some people believe that students should be take music,drama and art classes because is the only way to develop their mind,knowledge and to learn new things that help them for the future. Those classes help the students to get a mental and physical develop because the music make us to express feelings,emotions,or give to the audience a message that we want that they know and understand. The drama help us to develop our mind,but also,help us to use our body to express something that we want that people will know. The art class help us to represent,express and get abilities that students will do not know that they have. With those classes students will be exactly what they are and feel because they will express anything that they may want without get frustrated.

In conclusion some people believes that students should be take music,drama,an art class because they need new persons that express and give to them that knowledge that represent those classes because those students that will learn are the future and are the new generation. Also, because students need express feelings,emotions and develop their knowledge. Because they think that the students are interesting in others things that is not productive and they need to learn those important topic to not be loss and continue with the music, drama and art in our world.

Its a really good idea knowing what you going to do with your life once you're done with high school. There are so many teens that once they are out high school they don't know what jobs they want to start and study for it. I think that thats why they should have many more classes that thats what its going to help them continue with their thinking of what career to choose once they gradute high school. for example classes that are for automotive technology is a confortable job in a way that you learn more about cars but in a way is dangerous at the same time because cars have so many heavy parts that could injured you. Another confortable job is being a lowyer lowyers don't do much other than being in the computer or doing paperwork in that cause you dont have to be outside in the cold working on a bad job that involves working in a construction site.

There is so many students that drop out school because is not interesting to them but thats a bad idea of not going to school because if a student doesn't graduate they will be workingfor some restaurant not earning that much money and working so many hours thats why it is important for teens to stay in school so that the school could offer them on what job they will choose once they graduate high school.

My mom work cleaning houses she work hard to give my sister and I the things that we want, and she always have a goal to work by her self and have her own cleaning jod. Not working with a company that they make her work hard and pay her little money, when my mom came to his country [U.S.A] she start working for a women that women put her to do alot of house and pay her little money and when my mom told her that she was giving her alot of work she was angry at my mom.

My mom don't want that anymore and now my mom have her own job she one or two hause everyday and in a week she make five or eight hundrent dollars she have work hard to get want she wants.

My sister and I we were sharing the same room and we always have problems because she always have leave trush in the room she didn't pit it up I always have to do it and I was tired of that.

Idle refers to people who are not busy or keeping themselves occupied to their powers or implements. You would think being inactive serve a purpose, but personally i think it does not. To be occupied gets you to accomplish a lot in life. People who do not keep themselves busy tend to not get far in life.

In other words, to not be engage in work or activity is a very poor thing;there could be plenty of opportunities for you, but just because you are inactive you could miss these awesome opportunities. When we lack the ability to work or to keep ourselves occupied we are being inadequate. People who do not push or work themselves never actually really make it anywhere in life. Therefore, if we are always ""doing"", we will not fail to meet our expectations. If athletes were never idle or always ""doing"" some of them would of never made it in life.

However, inactivity does not serve a purpose because when you are inactive or simply not doing anything you miss out on what life has to bring you. We would accomplish so much if we always kept ourselves busy neverless. People who lack strength or courage are inactive. So when teachers say use your time wisely they are telling you to be Idle. It is wonderful when you are doing, being active, or pushing yourself because when you do these things you never miss out on any opportunity.

Lastly, when you are Idle you serve a purpose for yourself, family members, and you encourage others around. People who are active push themselved to do better. Being active can get you a good job because people will speak highly of you and recommend you to others. You ever heard of ""hard work makes the dream work"" when you put yourself to work anything is possible. Your peers around you will look up to you because you get stuff done and it would push them to do as you do.

In conclusion, Thomas Jefferson says when you are determined never to be Idle you serve no purpose and you are determined to get knowhere in life. Keeping yourself occupied can get you to places in life where you thought you could never be because you are putting the effort. People who move with no purpose are called lazy people these people do not accomplish as much as those who work.

It should not even be a doubt for the people who already faced this situation and has developed ideas.

Some of the people says that the first impression is important. Yes, it is important. This is your first look to a person or another thing. It is easy to be impressed or shocked. But it is easy to go over it and change it. Almost everyone has their own ideas, not just the person who impresses. Another person can come with better ideas than that person. An average person is developing his/her ideas since kindergarten. Maybe by language, maybe science/math, maybe sports/arts. But almost everyone has their developed ideas.

they are using their familiy's ideas. The person's family helps to create their mindset since they are born.

Is there any other way to change the first impression? Absolutely. A person always gain experiences from born to death. Even though the first impressions are confusing and shocking, it is not a problem for people. Because they already experienced this situation. They already failed it or succeed it. It is hard to solve the first impressions that the person faces. But that is the keypoint. By keep failing it they learn how to succeed it. They learn how to go over it. A person never ever should be shy for failing to handle this situation. No one is successful in their first experiences, even in their 10th-20th experiences.

Although some might agruenming that graduate in three is bad ideas actually graduate three is good ideas because be more mature for real world and you are able take full responsible of their own.

First reason is graduate three is good idea because be more mature for real world. Many people today they does know how real world work.

for example, many teenage does not know how real world work; teen drink and drive involve themselves in accident they hurt themselves and other people without think about their action because their parent bail them out of problem so they don't care if hurt some one are not.

All they know some has take care them. This shows that if teenage graduate three year they will be more mature for real world and they learning their lesson what to do and not what to do.

Another example,

is parent take teenage their full reasonable like pay for car insurance if brake the law parents stand for them say my child is innocent because parents defends for them if do some wrong convinces themselves they do right thing so be to late for them they think that way real world world work they wound't able to learned from their mistake. This show that teenage graduate three year help them to know their surrounding know full action they take full responsible own act.

Second reason is good ideas teenage graduate because it full rsponable of their own they will pay house rent and bills, light bill for example,

my mom pay for phone bill so real they care where money come all know is pay for bill. this shows teen will be more rsponable if pay the own bill be care bill not to go up. Another example I use to much light and water so when water and light bill come will go up ; my mom is only one that has pay bill.

this shows that if teenage doesn't how much they use water and light bill because their take care of those things for them.

Other some side might argument that graduate in three is bad ideas because you miss out life you don't know to have fun you will be stress out you know what make you happy. other example is on enjoy the moment you have as teenage.

Many students don't like to do activity with other people around them and going with what the teacher wants them to do.",2.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.6,1
2780,CBCA3CFF320B,"Boom!One day PROPER_NAME mom decided that she wanted him to join the distance learning classes.Where they could have online or video conferences with there school teachers.PROPER_NAME would sit around all day on his phone playing videos games instead of doing his online or video conferences.PROPER_NAME is like many others who thinks school is not all that important.I believe that schools should not offer distance learning to students.Therefore,students would not benefit from attending classes at home because students would have more free-time, students would be discourage that school is not important,Also they would skip classes to meet up with friends.

First,students would have free-time.For example,PROPER_NAME was home alone because her mom and dad works at a fast-food restaurant called LOCATION_NAME.PROPER_NAME knows she would have online conferences in the morning the next day at 8:30.Next morning came PROPER_NAME decided that she was not doing any conferences because she wanted to go shopping at the mall

for a up coming beach day that her aunt PROPER_NAME was having.PROPER_NAME then spend all day at the mall walking around looking in stores and talking to friends.Another example,There was a Vybz Kartel performance in LOCATION_NAME where they would give away free food and drinks at the gate. PROPER_NAME mom make sure to call home and remind her that she would have video conference in the afternoon with the teacher she loves the most PROPER_NAME but there was no answer so her mom decided to leave a voice mail ad hope when she sees the message she will know what to do. PROPER_NAME then left home after listing to her moms voice mail saying that she needs some alone time so she have to attend this party because all her friends were going and she wanted not to feel left out.Additional, PROPER_NAME boyfriend PROPER_NAME texted her saying he want to spend the day with her because he was leaving on October the 26,to go and stay for sum time in LOCATION_NAME with his dad. PROPER_NAME then got up pack a bag with clothe then left without anyone know she was out of the house without studying for her online conference presentation.c

Secondly,students would skip classes to meet up with friends.For example, PROPER_NAME skip distance learning classes to go enjoy the day with her best friend PROPER_NAME because it was his birthday and he invites her out for ice-cream and horse back riding. In addition, as for PROPER_NAME hanging out with his friends skiing in glove on snowboard or ice hockey is way cooler then staying home listening to his online conference teacher talk. Another example, PROPER_NAME dad PROPER_NAME just brought this new speedboat.one day when her dad was not at home she decided it is better not to do her online or video conference she was just going to invite sum of her friends over and they could take the boat for a spin at a hotel called HOTEL_NAME.They spent all day boating around instead of her doing her online classes.Another example, PROPER_NAME woke up one Monday morning saying she doesn't feel like she has a need to be taking distance learning classes so she pack her bag and call her friend PROPER_NAME to go with her to the countyside to look on lakes,mountain,and also valley.

Lastly,students would get discourage that school is not that important.For example, PROPER_NAME was taking AP biology class because she wanted to be a doctor, but because her mom start letting her taking online conferences for biology and start staying home she get discourage that school is not that important because if it was why would they would her to stay her.Next example, PROPER_NAME wanted to be a color guard coach but her aunt was telling her she does not have enough money to pay for her to attend the color guard practices her aunt heard about this distance learning program where she could stay home and learning about the skills for color guard for free. PROPER_NAME decided that if that could help she would take the class after two days PROPER_NAME said to her mom that the distance learning is not working out the way she wanted it to be also that is lower her expectation about school.Some people believe that if school offer distance learning to students it would allow them to have freedom.They are incorrect because most students are responsible.",2.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1
635,307D618AF467,"they'are looking to hire someone who is responsible and hard working and often a person who has experience. I think they should hire me because I am responsible and hard working even though I may not have any experience in the type of work.

First of all. I'll work hard to get the job and I'll do my best to understand the work that you all do. It may took some time, but it will be worth it. I am not a lazy worker, I am a fast leaner. I have done some other type of job, and I've done good because I don't just ask them to hire me, I ask them to hire me because I really want the job and work with them. However, sometimes people just don't like to hire people that doesn't have any experience with the job and they don't hire them or just ask them to leave, or they just tell them that they are not worth it to waste their time. Nowadays , people work where they can get accepted because other jobs would not accepted them and they do the to get at least the money to pay their rent and some other stuff. They don't think about what they are going to do if they keep working for hours and getting paid less, but if people would like to work for less hours and getting paid more, they would try to find a job where they can do their job for less hours and for more money. What I am trying to say is that I would like to be hire to this job, because I would work harder to be manager. I am qualify to this job even though I don't have any experience. Trying to work hard for a job is something that life teach you and could be worth it for me, and for my future. I could have a better life if I work harder, I would be prepare for any type of thing to do in this job. I may be ready for any type of things to do in this job.

Although, in may took some time to be able to work well, doing other type of job is kind of hard because people are used to work in different type of job and it is kind of hard because we cannot get used to work in this type of job in just one day and it is hard, but people could try, even me I would try to get used to this job and i will work hard enough to be manager. Even though, people may think that it is easy to do a job and get used to it fast, but it not true it is hard to get used to it to other job when you were doing other job. Some people are so cold heart and would not care about your feeling and would just try to make you quit the job and it is not right. If that happens to me I would not let it slide, because I would like to do my job in peace and with no interruption. It right for people to seek a better job position, even though if you are starting to do it, but it is normal for people to seek a better position: just like me a seek for better position in the job. However people would not let you in peace, they would try to make you quit, but if you don't let them be like that to you they would get tired of doing that to you and they would see how much you are getting better and with a better position. I would love to see people that hate me to see me grow in the job that I would do if they hire me, I am not going to be a lazy guy in the job I would work harder to get to manager and later on I would do more and so much more to be an owner of my own business. Who wouldn't want to be an owner of their own business, everyone does want to be and want to have it, just like me everyone have had a dream of owning a business but after all that start you have to work harder to get it. that what I would do in this job. Eventually, I would understand the stuff of the job and I would do them and be much better then the others.

Finally, doing a job that you have no experience, but you are a good candidate, that means your are capable of doing so much more and be a better worker or even be your own boss. You only have to work hard enough to get it and to achieved your goal, it doesn't matter if it take one or three years, you have to keep going until you achieved your goal and try to work hard to achieved that goal. I would do all that to achieved my goal, it doesn't matter if it take me two or three years; I would do my best to do it. I would take the risk and do it better than anyone else in this job, or other type of job, Learning different things can make you know more and more qualify to do other type of work. knowing more stuff about other type of jobs, it make you more qualify to do more and to be able to work in more stuff or even to owne your own business. Work hard and try to take a risk.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.4,1

Generic_City park it's located in Pennsylvania and is one of the places I would like to go there with my family. One of the reasons is because there are great attractions, like roller coasters and games. One thing I would like to see as soon as I arrive is the Chocolate factory and the Lazy river that is in the Aquatic park.

As I said before, ""There are awesome attractions in

Generic_City park"" let me talk to you about this amazing roller coaster I would love to ride and the name of that roller coaster is 'The Super dooper looper'.

The Super dooper looper is one of the greatest roller coasters and the reason is because this roller coaster has more loops then the other attractions and one of the loops is super big. But that's just the beginning, there is also one section in Generic_City park that I would like to go too, and is the area where all the video games are and you can win tickets every time you win a game. You can win prizes with those tickets and you can also buy food near that place.

I also said that I wanted to see the chocolate factory. The chocolate factory shows you the process of how they make that delicious chocolate, you can see everything there, from the beginning to the end, that is one of the best places I would love to go because you can't only see how they make chocolate, you can also buy it and feel the taste of the best chocolate ever 'Kisses'. The chocolate 'kisses' is one of my favorite chocolates that's why I would like to see the chocolate factory.

The aquatic park it's the best place to not feel to hot when is super sunny outside. Everybody sweats when they scream and feel the adrenaline of the roller coasters. After all of that you want to just relax and enjoy your day after walking and waiting in line, Well the Lazy River is one of the pools you would like to go in while you do nothing. The lazy river is one of all the attraction I would like to go. The fun part is that in the lazy river is that you can talk with your friends, and enjoy the journey after a long and fun day.

And that's is one of the places that I would like to go and maybe you will like to go, because Generic_City Park is a fun place where you can have fun with your family and friends, and have an amazing and unforgettable day, with so much adventures and fun.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.2,1
309,16B45E8AA9F3,"Honestly i think being honest can't always be hard or sometimes easy because, when you did something wrong you feel guilty, telling the truth gets rid of the guilt that you had, and also you feel a lot of stress. Letting the stress out in your body is good at one point so be honest!

Your body will feel like your hiding something and be afraid to talk so just be honest,

for an example, you broke your moms favorite vase but she doesn't know yet. ""You"" may be afraid to even talk to mother because ""you"" wont know if ""you should lie or be honest or you might even feel like you will get in trouble.

It's good to be honest because your parents will feel like they can trust you for an example being home by yourself and taking care of your younger siblings . If your not honest your parents might think that you're lazy and dont actually take care of your siblings while there out grocery shopping.

Not being honest can cause problems with you and your parents relationship. It's your job to be grateful of your parents, what they give you and how much they support you. If you have a friend who is good with their parents maybe try being like them and try your best to love and appreciate your parents at this moment.

Now that you know how to appreciate your parents and be honest and not lie, let me tell you this we all know we will lie maybe once or twice but after you can just say, ""Hey I'm sorry i was not telling the truth, will you forgive me?"" Everything will all be better. Be more respectful say it with love and like you actually mean it. People will feel loved and that they actually mean to you.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.1,1
743,394F5867B7EC,"Working alone is great but have you ever thought about the benefits of working in groups? for example, when you are working with a group of people it it easier to get ideas; for example,you can all put your thoughts tougher and find out the resolution. Also working with a group makes it faster to finish the tasks; some people take longer than others so its good to have people around to help.

Most people believe that working alone is better but working in a group is more beneficial for example,if there is a problem that needs to be solved it is easier to solve it because there are more people to figure out the problem and to give their opinions; which will help throughout the way. In other words, if one of the group members has trouble with the assignment another group member could help them out;instead of figuring it out by themselves.

Working in groups could also make assignments become complete faster for example,some students while working alone take a long time and end up having to take their assignments home for homework; while in a group they can come up with a solution together and get it complete. It will also benefit the teacher because there won't be any late papers.

There are benefits of working in a group but there are also benefits of working by yourself for example,sometimes it gets loud in the group and it will be hard for them to focus and get their work done also some students like to mess around and play fight instead of getting there work done. Even tho working in groups could cause a lot of talking and play fighting , it is still a more beneficial way for students.

In conclusion, working alone is a better way for students to show what they know but working in groups is more helpful for students who are struggling. It has been listed on google that Researchers have proven that it is a more helpful way to learn.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.3,1

Nothing in our live will stop use from doing what we would like to do in the furture. if some tell you that you will never get there in live dont belive what other peolpe thing about you, just do you that you will be albe to do anything in live. also It would be great if alot of thing could be done but how by alot of people working on only one thing that's for sure would finish the proeses quicker and get other thing start alot fast, but they just can't everyone has a part to do when they are working on project, that would be working on building new cars and, new home. that one thing that people would wish to do if they could accomplish anything they would go right ahead by do it and finish it until they secces accomplish it, what they dream for finley happened.

One way to example how we can do this is by getting a job or something that he/she would like to do in live to be the best they can be or just be their own boss by having your own bunisses, no one telling you what to do or nothing like that but one thing that they have to do is keep track of how make people are working for you, pay those who are warking all day and who ever is on time for work. but that for who own there own bunisses.

3063,DA26E5E2C08E,"Many people believe that teenagers should have a 10 p. m curfew on the weekdays and during mindnight weekends. In my opinion I say having a 10 p. m curfew on the weekdays for teens that works and get out of work late might not be a good idea. Another example can be, you never know when an emergency can happen at your house and or anywhere else and you have no one to pick you up or an emergency hoccurs at your house and you have no one to take you, at least you got your son/daughter to help you out. Lastly during high school is when you get a lot of projects to take home and when you have test the next day and a project due before that can be a hand full and it can stress them out, by letting them do their work and have more time to study, it improves their grades in school and they do better in their classes.

I have a lot friends that as soon as they get home they get ready to go to work, and most of them come out at 10 p. m but by the time they get home it can a little more passed 10 p. m depending how far their job is from their house. Many teenagers help to support their family in whatever they can, having a job that can help them support your family is truly a good help. Letting your son work passed 10 p. m is not something you want to get in between due to thier boss changing their schedule sometimes and if hes helping you out by giving you money to pay a bill or to go buy food for the house it's worth him/her working a little late. I have friends that work very hard in school and after they home they change, they put on their uniform and they go to work to bring food the house due to his mom not getting payed good enough at her job. Others work to buy themselves their own needs, for exmaple when they have school dances and you need to buy a ticket and your mom has no money, by working you can buy a ticket and attempt to the dance. Another example is prom, prom can be one of the most exiting activities high school has, but it can also be very expensive if you have no money and your trying to look nice and presentable.

You never know when an emergency can occur at your house and you have no one to call or help you out. I once had a friend that his mom was pregnant and he had little sibblings that could not drive but him, and as the pain started to get worst he took her the Hospital and thank god everything turned out fine for them but the reaon they didn't call anyone else for help due to the fact they we're new in the city and didn't knew anybody and it was passed midnight, so his older son carried her to the car and drove her to the Hospital. You never know when an emergency can happen to you or someone in your family at anytime. Another example was when my dad and I drove to Walmart to buy my mom some medicine because she had a bad fever and a headche and we left the house exactly at 10:30 p. m and when we got back home we gave her medicine and the next day she felt a lot better.

During high school is where I have gotten a lot of projects that are hard to make and thier due two days later, not only do I be having projects, I be having homework from all my teachers and test that I need to study. Staying up late to complete your work can most definately help you complete your work or at least do more than what you couldn't had finished if you were to sleep at 10 p. m. Whenever I have a lot in mind like projects, homework, make-up work and test that I need to study really be stressing me a lot until a point where I feel like i'm being rushed and I can't concetrate right if I have other things in mind that I need to get done. But by having no curfew you can go to bed late, but at least you were calmed about it and you werent rushing into getting it done, when you took your time.

Many people can see 10 p. m curfew as something that should be done, but think about the consequences that it can have for example, not being able to work and help your family because can work passed 10 p. m or you never know when something can happen to anybody at anytime and there's noone to help out, or when you need more time to complete your project that you weren't able to finished due to curfew. Think about many other things that can be done, other things that can help others.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.3,1
796,3DCF3E6F4A13,"Well most students enjoy summer vacation because was one of the most beautiful station in the year for one all of students, they enjoy with the families, friends that things in the summer, though some teacher say the summer break is too long and that students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall.

I think that summer is one of the most special station or period because you share more with your Family, Friends, and all students have merit to share more with the most important persons in their lives because a lot of our parents working 10 to 12 hours of Monday to Saturday in sometimes Sunday too, and they don't have a lot of time to share with they families.

In my case, I love when it's summer vacation because I have a lot and good experiences with my Family, with God when left to the house our going to different places, I feel that is these period is when I share more with my mom, She is the most important person in my life, she is who are always with me in the good and bad things, she is who give me advice every day about the good and bad things to not make that things that I don't need to do and don't pass for a lot of things that she pass when she was young, I love these time of summer because is when I pass more time with my mom and she help me to be better every day in my School, Work, Church and everywhere that going.

The mother is one of the most important person what I have in my life because she is who always are in there for me and help to always be good person, good in my school and a lot of more things. And I have beautiful experiences with God and these is that I love more is to pass my time with God because I learn more about things important and that help my life.

I think the 2 months that all students have to summer is a good time because are pass like 9 months in school and these is too much because sometimes you want to make something but school is to difficult and that people can't to share with special people.

Well when the educators or teachers say that summer vacation is too long because student do not retain the information is not true because the students retain these information about Works, Projects, Homework, Classwork the information is in our Brain, Mind, are that things important and basic.

I don't agree that person argue should be year-round and that only have 3-4 weak breaks in the summer is like only one month and you can't enjoy and make your summer funny with you parents because you are thinking in school, I don't be agree with these the summer is when you can pass more time with your important person because there is the period when they have the vacation to, I thing the summer is for enjoy and pass a funny time with your Mom, Father, Brothers, Sisters, and all your Family.

I say that is good to have 2 months and like 2 weeks of vacation because you clearing you Mind, you don't thing in a lot of Homework or Works of School. I have one experience in my life when I were in Generic_City that only thing that I have in my MInd was Homework, Projects, Presentations in my School, Programs of my School and one day my family say I want to going to share with all and I say I can't go because I have a lot of work to do and I need to finished and my uncle say Generic_Name is time to share with your family, is time to you clearing your mind about school and I say another time I need to finish my works about school and all my family going to share and I stay in my house working in all my projects of school and I sit in my room, I was thinking you loss beautiful time with my family for to make my works, and I say is time to you share more with your family because your family in every moment stay there.

Everything the specific moment when you have time with share with your family, friends share because you don't not in what moment you can loss your Mom, Father, Brothers, Uncle, Sisters, Aunt, Cousins, etc, when is time to school make all your works in time.

Don't take you Education like obligation, taken like one of the opportunity to be better.

In some moments you have difficult time but you need to continue, to be stronger, the education is where you learn more about the all things Human, Animals, Solar System, H2o and a lot of things important what help you life in the future you learn things what in your future you can put in practice, you can teaches another person that need to know more.

For everything have time, your Family, Works, Friends, School all these things depends about you, for these reason I think When is time to school is school, When is time to your family is family.

So you need to think and put your agenda in order to you make the important things in order so right now I change a lot of things in my life and these it is the Monday to Friday to be concentrate in my Education, Saturday to Sunday in God and my family, when it's time to pass with my family I pass time with my family and now I share more.

And for these reason I think the summer vacation is important because a lot of students don't have their parents in here maybe live 8 hours, 10 hours in when it's vacation they going to pass time with their Parents.

You need to be have the order in your life you need to make time for everything.

The Education is important because is where you learn things important but most important for me is my family because they can one day no be in here in the Earth because they dead.

And I think when it's summer vacation the Educators or teacher enjoy to their vacation and pass good time with their family and when it's time to come back to school review somethings because not everything forget somethings are in the brain that only need to do is to review.

Then the summer vacation are so good 2 months and 2-3 weeks to you enjoy with all the persons important and special to you, so enjoy and pass a funny summer vacation.

So enjoy, teachers don't thing the summer is too long because is a shorter period that one student have for vacation, teacher enjoy vacation!!.",2.0,2.5,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.8,1
3722,F85B1C875E6C,"The limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has a negative effect on peoples lives because there is less communication, you dont really get to enjoy life as much, and your less capable of showing your creativity or smartness. Technology has had a big effect on humans from adults to toddlers all around the world in schools and in many other environments. With less communication due to technology may cause conflicts between people. You may have not been able to comprehend what was said or happened because you werent communicating. Not communicating causes people not to understand what you mean or where you are coming from in any situation if its in a relationship or friendship. Communication is something everyone should be comfortable to do and know about.

You dont really get to enjoy life as much because with technology you dont really focus on anything else that is happening around you. When your at family events you may be on your phone and not focusing on your family enjoying dinner, making funny jokes or opening up about something new and important to them. You may be at school and miss on all school events or the kindness of people around you. It does have a big impact on your family because you may care and love them but having technology around really makes them think otherwise.

Technology may get in the way of you showing your creativity and smartness. When you are at work or at school and you have been put in a place that you have to prove what you are capable of. A teacher may have assigned you to activities or have you do homework but you may have not done it or been able to. You arent capable of outsmarting someone or something through technology and creating new things or being open minded to learn new things. Everything may be different due to you being used to technology. The limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has a negative effect on peoples lives because there is less communication, you dont really get to enjoy life as much, and your less capable of showing your creativity or smartness. Many are used to it and carry it everywhere with them and it may be a distraction in certain places or situations. You complete much more tasks without technology in schools, with families, and jobs.

Having a cell phone in classroom make teacher now who is apsent and who's not with some new technology application and we cell phone they can done there work easyer.

By not allowing students use there cell phone they will lose time that they not having it, and make things difficult and students they will make a lot of nuse bye talking to each other in some group project.

996,4C3AFB55C4F7,"Imagine someone that you know, that is trying to show you what maturity looks like. And she set a example for you to see, by how she talk and how she treats her friends and family. You watch how the person act and talk. Later, you start to follow what that person does. This influenced you to also be respectful to the people around you. Setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence others because people follow what you do,know right from wrong, they are going to influence more other people.

First reason, setting a good example to influence others is the best thing because people follow what you do. They look up to you as a role model for them. Whoever you hang around with, that is whoever going to influence you. For example, if someone is doing a act of kindness, then you are going to do the exact same thing, because it influenced you. Philosopher Albert Schweitzer said,"" Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" Overall, if one person set a good example in life, it influence the others also.

Second reason, setting a good example is the best way to influence others because you know right from wrong. If no one set examples for others to see, then they would not know what to do when difficult situation arrives. Examples guide you to do what you know is right. People would not know how to act if there's no examples to be set. In summary, examples setting by other people help you make good decisions in life.

Third reason, some people may believe that setting examples by someone's behavior is not the best way to influence others. However, I believe that setting examples is the best way to influence others because it's not just one person that they are influencing, but many more people. For example, if a girl help a elder lady that needed help with carrying groceries inside the house, then others will see that and learn to help people that are in need also. Because of that one influence, others will care for people that need help. If one person set a good example, then others will also set a good example for many more people. In conclusion, many people will be influenced because of that one example that people set.

The best way to influence someone is through examples that are set by others, and how their behavior and attitudes are towards people. Setting examples is a good way to show people what you are trying to teach them and it gives them a idea of what's happening. Through all of these examples that people had set for you, they will influence you. When you do the example, because it influenced you, others will also catch that influence from you. So yes, setting examples is the only thing that will influence people and make a big impact in people's lives. ",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.5,3.3,1
1820,894C9DC473A0,"Albert Einstein said "" Imagination is more important that knowledge"" do I agree with Albert Einstein or do i disagree I picked agree and I'm going to tell you why I picked it.

Reason one imagination is all about being creative like thinking about stuff to do and stuff to wear and writing a song you got to use your imagination and speaking you got to use your imagination just to know what your about to say before you even say the word.

Reason two Albert Einstein used his imagination to be really smart and creative. Also people who invented stuff they used their imagination and not only that they made millions just by using there imagination, and construction workers got to use there own imagination just to construct a big buildings and houses.

Reason three you can make money from just using your imagination I seen people make lots of money just selling stuff they made at there own homes and seen so many companies go from not making anything like money to being this really large company that made millions just from using there imagination.

And thats why i agree with Albert Einstein saying ""Imagination is more important than knowledge""",2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.7,1
2113,9E8984D81AC3,"The only talent or skill I have would be doing tricks. I also think that mostly everybody can do it so in my opinion that is not a talent. I have other talents which are that I am good at sports like basketball ,softball,, track, and soccer. I been doing it seen's I was little my dad wanted my siblings to be out of the house instead of being on our phones so we had to learn to do sports.

The first one I learned is soccer because it's just kicking a ball and running . The cool part about soccer is doing the tricks and everything. Soccer isn't big as well know as it should be. In the middle east it's big but not like basketball or football the whole world loves those sports. Also in the England they call it football instead of soccer but I get it makes a perfect name for it because you just kick it with your foot.

The second one I learned was track it wasn't that hard because you run or jump. When running in the track it is not about winning because the wind is in your face and running and your mind goes blank it feels so good when you are stressed. The long jump is my favorite because when I jump it's like flying then I touch the ground and it is gone. That why running is my favorite it's not about beating the other person.

The other one I learned is I think it was basketball. basketball because it is a mystery if you make it or not you just shoot and hope you make it .Seeing basketball players on TV I think help me to be better just like them. The thing about is that the boys ad girls are separated because they think the boys are too rough for them the girls can be rough too but thats why they made the WNBA [woman national basketball assonstion]. In my school they have one for girls and one for boys but a lot of people come watch he boys one way more than the girls.

The next one is softball this one I just wanted to do something different when the other seasons are over. It was boring at first when you learn how to play it becomes a game not a sport. In school we have softball but we don't have baseball for boys but I wish we did I think is unfair that the girls have one but they don't. I wish we play it at gym but we don't all we do is play field hockey. Softball is also good arm excise if you play it all the time. Thats why of all the sport my favorite is track.

1404,6C16FC9FE7A4,"Some people think that is a good idea, but actually it is not. I think we shoul keep folllowing the plan thatbis already planted by the goverment.

The reason are so many and complicated to explain right now, that is why I am only gonna explain and give example to three of those reason. One of them are that students should not go to college at very early age or go to the minlatary at very early age, Because of the their are not older anough and are not anough responsible handle to much presur in college and in high school, and most ot the time they don't really know what they want to be when grow up, and the course during summer and evenings are not much presur for the students.

They don't have the experience about what is life look like and how harts it is. They would not have any freedom duirng their all life if they follow that plan, because they always will be ""between four walls"", that's not the life that people want and that's not the sad path that parents want for the children I guess and I hope, but you never now what parents want and never ask what you want, and is another presur on their shoulders.

The elective courses are a way to expriment other classes and learn something else that students really want to do or maybe would like to do, I admint that students will learn the necessary, but not what they want, their will be sad if they never had a freedom to do what they want to.

In my conclusion: it's better to take things with calm and peace, not to take it to fast, we still have bunch of time to decide what's really matter and what's matter to us.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.9,1
2864,CFEC920440CE,"We accomplish more by doing tasks that we are assigned with to complete.

We have always get something done if the tasks or assignments are done.

Take for example people that work jobs, day and night they tend to get work or tasks or assignments done.

How do they get stuff done, workers usually plan it out like steps to go though to complete them if they dont follow the steps like how are they going to complete the task or assignment to get it done. Workers always need to plan it out before proceeding to the task or assignment to finish or complete. For example Generic_Name wants to figure out how to complete his project, he need to plan step by step and what materials he needs for the project. He follows the step by step plan but realizes what he needs to do later on he gathers the materals and starts to complete his project just by always doing it.

All of us always have to something to complete any tasks or assignments to finish.

It's not going to work if we dont always doing something or plan it out , it's the reason why if you wanna get it stuff done you have always do it in order complete it. For example take school students for a example, they tend to always to get work done so they can free time to themselves and usually making sure the answers they write down are correct to get good grades. School students have determation to complete classwork they're assigned to, so later on they don't have to complete it for homework at home for free time. It's better to always complete work so you don't have to complete later on. For example any job work usually has work to do like car manufactures , they have a assembly to work on because it's where the cars are starting to be made by the workers in the assembly line. They have to work the machines to put the parts on the cars that are being work on so it can shipped of to the car dealership. Everything revolves around on always getting something on time, so it doesn't become a problem later on. Everyone like to job workers to school students alwayss have to something , its why we tend to get stuff done.

Always accomplish it by doing it

Reasons why, we have to do it if we tend to get our task or assignments done then that work doesn't get it the way of what you are trying to on the next task. Accomplishing that we are trying to get to is a good way to start off, you see like CEOs of a company planning what they want done and to figure it how to accomplish it. For example take CEOs they're good at getting stuff done and accomplished it pefectly cause they own businesses and tell his workers what food products or drinks that stores need for people to attract to buy their goods or clothes. People always have to plan to work towards to they want to achieve or accomplish even for their future. it's not going to work if you don't put the effort into the assignment or tasks to make it happpen. You always have to make sure what you want and to make it happen so that your future has more opportuniites.

3720,F83702EEB830,"I agree with it because everyone has to do something productive in school and playing a sport is good for our health, yearbook writing is good for our spelling, and serving in a student council makes you be more confident and talk more with other people.

Playing a sport is the best way to make our bodies stronger and healthy, it also helps us mentally when you are going through times going outside and playing helps you a lot. Playing a sport in school helps you have more energy and be ready to learn it likes opens your mind. Soccer for example is helps your body be stronger, Volleyball helps your hands be more stronger, Basketball helps you jump higher, and Football helps you run faster.

Writing or coloring the yearbook is a great idea too, because you are writing something that everyone is going to see so i know you gonna write neat and correctly. Coloring is good for our brains too it helps us be calm and out of stress. Spelling is one of the most important things and writing helps it improved it, coloring is something that not everyone knows how to do it, but by practicing we are gonna learn.

Serving in a student council helps you a lot because you learn something very important and thats learning how to communicate with other people and be nice. Sometimes its hard to communicate or talk to other people but we have to do it because sometimes the people needs someone to talk to and someone to be there for them. Helping to helping is a best thing you can do maybe you are not getting something from it but at least your being a helper.

2614,C1E9D98B3613,"I personally agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson with his quote saying ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" The reason i agree is because I believe that you have to set your goals higher, if mastered something already. Its always alright to fail trying to master your goal because nobody is perfect. You also need to try different goals to master so youre good at several things.

The first reason why i believe you should set your goal higher, if you have already mastered your goal is because if you keep doing the same thing youve done over and over and have already done great at it, you will not see any growth in you. For example if i was in a soccer team and played for a rec team. Which rec is when you sign up and get put on a team with no tryouts. If i played and score almost every game and always outplayed my opponents. I wouldnt grow as a soccer player because the opponents would be easy for me and wouldnt be a challenge so i would have to set my goal higher. For a higher goal i would have to move up to travel to see growth in me and have a challenge in the game.

I believe that people also disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson because they are scared to set there goal higher when they have already mastered it. The reason i think this is because they are embarrassed to fail and not do something right. When i'm reaching a goal of mine like getting three goals in the net in a soccer game. I work hard to try to accomplish my goal so i can master it and score three goals every single game. Sometimes i fail and dont score three goals but i always tell my self its alright because when youre reaching a goal you will fail at least once or probably more then once. Which makes me work harder. Nobody is perfect and always a good thing to fail to learn about your mistakes.

The last reason why i agree is because you have to try to master different things in life. Sticking with the same thing you mastered will just not make you good at anything else. Its always great to have different things youre good at because you can do a lot of other things. If you dont like any of the goals you want to master and cant reach it. Its always great to have other ones along the other one youre trying to reach because i know a lot of people change their thoughts and want to do more then one goal at a time.

You have to set your goals higher if mastered something so you can see growth in yourself. When setting your goals higher you will fail at least once, you shouldnt worry because it makes you learn about your mistakes and so you wont do what you did to make you fail. Also you have to try different things to master to be good at several things in life. This is why i agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson quote he wrote.      ",3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,1

My second reason is when you eat health on school days your body will feel better and relax and also when you eat healthier foods your body can help you in the future as you grow older health foods in school would be a great way for students not to be sick and they need protein to grow.

My thrid reason is if you take away our favorite food most students wont eat the healtheir food, remember when their was no Fried Chicken friday at lunch and thats like everyones favorite food the school was so upset they didnt eat lunch for the day over chicken. So in conclusion I think that we should balance them out like their should days were we eat health foods and days we can eat favortite foods.

Whenever a student misses a day or days of school they fall behind. They then have to do extra work to get all caught up. It causes lots of students stress and sometimes failure. Weather can also cause school to cancel. For instance, snow storms, or floods but working at home doesnt cause you to miss out on school. Students can never be absent in online school because everything is on a laptop. They will always be up to date with there assignments or exams. Students don't have to worry about being late to class anymore either. Instead, students will be stress free sitting on there bed learning.

Every student would rather be at home working then to be working in a classroom. Our own homes make us feel relaxed and clam so therefore, its a safe environment to work in. We don't need to do fire drills or lock down drills in our homes because we know our homes are secure. Also, when students are focus and working on assignments, the time goes by to quick.

Most of the people got to the point where they become successful, thinking that they have the sufficient knowledge to stay where they are and not move forward. The most common mistake that someone can make is believe that they have learn enough to the point where is nothing else to learn. I strongly agree with the words that Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, people that have got the title of professional and keep being successful in their daily are the ones that are still adding productive information to their life and career. The actual key that makes people become professionals everyday and give them the recognition of master is through the process of keep learning new things.

Convince yourself that yo are not good enough ""Yet"" this to motivate you to believe that you need to learn more. Examples that we can see everyday, teen mothers when a young girl or even in some cases girls that are still considering a kid have to been each to be a mother. Teen mothers learn through the pregnancy to; take care of the baby, change diapers, give appropriate food and how give them bath. The process of being a mother for the first time, does not end when you give birth to the baby. There is not a book where it details you how to take care of your child, even if there is one it would probably not be as helpful as you learning each day.

If there were a class of ""How to be a mother for the first time if you are a teen"" it would not cover all the expectations that you baby requires because you will be the only one that knows your baby, its behavior and what its needs are. Even adult mothers have said that they keep learning how to be mother everyday.

Do not push back yourself because of the fact that you seen to be far away from your objective. If you have been studying for years, since first grade and still have to go to an University, it could make you think if it would be necessary those extra years. The answer is yes, even if you have been in school for about 10 years and still have to go to college to get you the information that you need to be able to get a decent job, yes it is necessary. The years where you have been taking classes that does not look that t would help you in the future in any way. They do have a purpose, and it is to inform you and help you to develop skills that have not been discover, whether you like math, history, science or languages. Any subject that you have learn is to help you find what you really like and how you can used for the future. That is why there are those extra years for college, to start to focus on your objective and teach you what you actually need to become successful. After you have got the extra years, does not mean your learning have also stop, when you get to practice for the career you have selected you keep developing your skills and growing as a person, and this because of the motivation of keep going beyond of what you already manage.

Going beyond your expectations as a person would bring you benefit to your life. If you get a job based on your skills, experiences or knowledge it would also require the same process of keep learning. If you got the job where you always wanted and they approved you to work there because you qualify and you have study the career for years does not specific mean you know everything and you would directly get to the work and lead yourself to become another worker. Like always and how the Author Ralph Emerson emphasizes you would have to keep trying new material. You have experienced the process to gather the sufficient information to get this job, but now you are being told to go beyond and now you need to learn the system of the factory, office, building, hospital or any apartment you have being positioned. In this case does not mandatory need to keep educating yourself, but to improve in your work and become an efficient person you need to keep learning new skill that would apply to your job. Like is being remarked again the importance of keep learning to do new things so you can grow.

The importance of always going forward and learn to manage new things will make you grow as a person in your life and improve the labor work. If you do not try nothing new and do not applied on your daily, do no expect to become successful as a person. You are the only one that knows how to lead yourself and what weakness and strengths you have, as a captain of your life you know where your boat should go, the wind could make you take different directions which is why you have to recognize where exactly your destination is. The fact the it seems that you have got far enough where you might feel afraid to go beyond, which could ruin what you already have does not mean it will. People argue that they are scared to keep going forward and decide to just stay stand where they are because is been far enough. You should not let yourself be the obstacle to keep learning new things to do. If you feel like that was enough and you got to were you stay, it is because you can go more fatter with the experience that you have. Do not stay in one point and make sure to keep walking and doing new stuff to help you grow, do something new everyday and prove yourself that you have become a successful person every time you go a step ahead. Keep growing to encourage yourself and others to keep doing something new and always going in different direction without stopping.",2.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.2,1

Todays technology allows people to do many different tasks without having contact with others in a positive way. Technology today is now making it easier for us humans to do things and also showing us what the furture could look like in a couple of years. Why would this be a negative thing ? if people are just trying to make are lives easier. For an example lets say you need to get some where but fast and you don't have a ride there is now a app where you send your location and give the address to place you need to go and somebody will take you. Technology is such a great thing and its becoming greater each and everyday.

There are many different types of apps that you can download on your phone today for anything. lets say that your at home and your really hungry but you don't want to leave the house you can download an app called grubhub that will make sure you dont miss a meal. what is grubhub its an app that delivers food from anywhere. All you do is tell the person what you want to eat the location of the place to pick up the food and your address so they know where to drop it off. And its that easy this thing that we call a phone can make all this happen with a little bit of typing. these apps are for free too but it may cost for the food but not everything is free in life.

Computers are also a big part of technology. Computers and laptops are used everyday could be for school for work for anything. Computers help out a lot in school for anyone who needs to do research and any type of information he or she did not know about. Laptops are great aswell its a computers that folds and is for on the go great for anyone that travels a lot or somebody that works on computers alot. Laptops are becoming better everyday there are even touch screen ones some that fold backwards and its crazy to think about because what do you think is going to happen a couple years from now technology is perparing us for the furture.

Technology is making our lives easir each and everyday. With out technology I wouldn't be able to take this take I wouldn't be able to the police if I'm in danger. Its a great use for us humans this will never be a negative thing to me. We need technology in our lives so we know whats going on around us.

2040,99CAD0AF3560,"Is playing a sport a fun activity for students? Does it help students exercise? Does it help students get healthier? I agree that playing a sport is a fun activity to all students for many reasons.

To begin with, playing a sport is a good way to be more energetic. Playing a sport can help students exercise. Students might do some warm up games, do some work outs or they can practice at home with their families. Playing a sport can also help students get healthier. Students get more energetic, eat healthy food, and get in good shape. Playing a sport can help students do better things. They could run faster, get stronger, and it can help them do better in class

On the other hand, playing a sport is bad for some students. Students might get sick for being outside. If is winter and students are playing outside all day they might get sick from the cold or if is spring they might get sick from pollution. Some students might get injured. Students might break their arms or legs for playing with others students that are bigger than them. Some students might not be good at sports. Students might suck at soccer, football, or basketball and they won't play.

Even though playing a sport is bad for some students, they can still play. Even though students get sick they can still play. If some students get sick they can get medicine and go back to play. Even though some students might get injured they can recover. Some students might break their legs or arms, they can wait a few weeks and go back to play. Even though some students might not be good at sports they can still learn. Some students might suck at soccer, football. or basketball with practice they can learn how to play.

In conclusion, playing a sport is fun because you play with your friends, run around, or just feel the wind in your face. It helps students exercise by doing some warm up games, work outs, or practice at home with their families. It helps students get healthier by eating healthy food and get in good shape.

Sometimes student do not sleep as well, or they do not have much energy to play, because they do not eat before start the game. Everybody needs to know before they have a game we need to eat healthy, and drink enough water. Sometimes famous death for that kind of reason, so we need to learn about the experience. Life is very important for everybody, so we need to look what's the first thing we can do before they think and act too.

Family is more important than the game, so they do not have time to practice. Sometimes family want to explore places for example; New York, Florida, and Boston that state has beautiful place to swim play, and we can do everything. That's why student do not have time to practice the game. Game is an important thing they can learn too much, and maybe in the future they can get a award like a professional or famous on games.

Some students do not have time to practice, because they need to work to pay the bills for example; pay the insurance for the car, pay the rent where they live, and also pay the bill for the cellphone. That's is the reason we do not have time to practice. That's why we failure the game, because we work at night and then we are going to school all day. When it is time to practice the game we do not have energy to play, so that is the cause we lost the game every time. We needed to work a part-time on that way we got more time to practice the game, so the next time we can win the game. Sometimes the family do not help them, because they said we need to learn how they make a money to obtain the food for each person.

Eating healthy is good for everyone, so we need to eat every day. Also we can eat fruit every time, because that has to much protein. That's is the first thing we can do before beat the team, because that make they strong. they need to go the gym too, because that help you to get a healthy body. Sometimes the first thing we can do is eating, and then go to sleep this is not a good choice for them.

Please help all the students who is trying to work and continuing to go to school, because they are the future on the world. We need to help them because sometimes we have a dream, but no body try to help that's why students can't realized they dreams. If they can continuing to study in the future they can earn to much money, because in the past it was hard for them, but now is more easily then the first time when they start                             ",2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.7,1

For example, if we want to invest our money in something that is very expensive and we do not have a lot money to pay it but we insist to invest in that we are not going to get ahead.

The students who have a job can have problems with their bosses and it can make a more hard schedule for the student because they don't gonna have any time to rest and they can have troubles at school if they don't rest the necesari for their health and their consentration at school; other negative thing is because it's unnecessary because it's not a big chage, if the school want to save energy one day don't gonna make a big change and also, maybe it's okay as it's and I think the original schedule with five days of school is good for all and it don't make any problem, and the last negative thing I see is the hours of work of the teachers, the teachers maybe don't do enough hours of work and don't get the same payment and maybe can affect them in that way.

These idea also have positive things like the chance for students and teachers to rest more or just for students, they have more time to do homework or work, other positive thing is to save a bit of energy and some resources, in some way the school can get benefit of these.

I know that us student are responsible for our grades in school but a B average just to play sports or be i some sort of activity is pretty dumb most students have C averages if you change this policy you will have lots of mad parents or students i think you don't want to be the bad guy here.

I know parents say that its good to be in any type of sport but you have to like its because it keeps you out of trouble well its true i mean if you change this policy you might see this straight student go from a good student to always calling his/her patrol officer to see if he/her doesn't have any type of weapon's please TEACHER_NAME think about how this is going to affect the students and our community.",3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.9,1
3646,F54386A8122B,"Today i will be discuss if it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age? most may disagree with this statement, but i will hopefully grab your attention and hope you could agree with me.

I think it is a good for students to decide on there career this early because number one in today's society everything is depended on technology. What are students into nowadays there phones, video game, IPads , computers, etc. So pretty high advanced technology is everywhere, My point that i'm trying to make here is that the majority of students get either there phones or computers at a young age. So in my opinion i think that there future is set way before high school. But again my point here is that yes i do agree that careers should be set when they enter high school.

With entering high school students are introduced to a lot of programs at the start of there new journey to life. theres programs in high school that take students to colleges and take them on tours or they either tell the what to major on in that specific college, With planning early for your future you save time for stressing out last minute. I feel like this shouldn't just be small societies making students plan really early this should be the whole nation because as students we are the future of the united states so why not start 4 or 5 years ahead. Although some people may say that this is a huge distraction only because students would want to just focus on the future instead of focusing on whats happening right now.

So the main argument is that I 100% agree with students choosing there careers at a young age. My main reason is that the early the better with chances of programs and guidelines to help you on your way to a better education theres no way that you can stress for a career. in addition to my statement I also think that schools should have a bunch of programs helping students out with there future that way they won't stress there last year of high school, and they won't have to apply to colleges not knowing what to do.

318,1721F085F81E,"I disagree with this statement because your first impressions of someone or something can change overtime. When you first meet someone you automatically get an impression of that person from the way they dress, or the way they speak basically the way they do things.

Now a days people jump into conclusions, they never met the person, they just go off upon looks. For example say a teenager is wearing all black with ripped jeans and they got their pants down low, adults are going to think that teen is possible a gangster or a thug but thats not the case, thats just the style now a days.

First impression can change overtime, once you get used to something your mindset changes, say you meet a friend and you guys start talking and your friends starts giving you an attitude, your going to assume that your friend doesn't like you so you keep that mindset. Yall start talking again and this time it's going way better, you and your friend are laughing, overall just having a good time now your opinion has changed towards the person.

there was this guy he started to stare at me every few seconds so i thought he had a problem or something but he looked familiar but i couldn't figure out where i've seen him from, later that day he ended up being in my last block class, the teacher made the class work in pairs so i got up and asked the guy if he wanted to be my partner, he said sure and we began working, we started talking about random things until he said ""you look familar"" then he said didn't we go to the same middle school together, then it clicked I was friends with this guy back in middle school and haven't seen him in a long time, after that day we began talking almost everyday.

The first impressions aren't always impossible to change, you learn to change your mind overtime and start accepting things for what it is.          ",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.2,1
669,33E25E6A8028,"dear principal, i think students should be allowed to bring cell phones to school during the school day. It is important to allow students to have them incase of a emergency . cell phones are also important to have because they are very useful if something goes wrong they are able to call 911 or 311 for personal help. They should also be allowed because cell phones is a good way to let students keep contact during school free hours.

It is important to let students have them incase of a emergency . A lot of students can use their phone if they have been hurt . If a student gets bullied by other peers they can call the school and let them know that someone has been hurt by other students from school. If something bad had happen to that student during school hours they can always use their cell phone.

they are also useful to have because sometimes a lot of things can go wrong.

Students at some point we have accidents like spilling milk on our shirts or not making it to the washroom and we can use our phone to call mom and dad to bring us extra clothing. cell phones are not always to text but also just a good thing to have during school.

you never know what can happen during the end of the day like going home. Their are so many dangerously things that can happen and its important to have a cell phone to call 911 . and they are cool to be allowed during free classes and be able to use them at some point during our day.(:",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1
1619,7B0C76128726,"I agree with Prime Winston Churchill; in he saying there is a lot of true and motivation. Failure is the most important element in the pursuit of success. Being successful is not a easy thing for anyone; there is a journey that you have to get through with many obstacles that you may fail at the first time. Also, no matter how many times you fail, you shouldn't give up on you want to do. When you continue to fail, your learn a lot from this mistakes or problems. The better thing are never easy to secure; we always make mistakes, but never too late to start again. As Winston once said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm'' This statement is most certainly true if we are welling go put in the effort to past though feature and attain real success.

If you really want something you going struggle for that and effort the most you can. Everyone who is successful has been through things that has caused them to fail in something the admired dearly, but remember you should never lose hope; mistakes allow you to view your challenge from a different perspective. Failure is only an opportunity to begin again, only this time with a better plan and more understanding. Failure is an unavoidable obstacle, so you must be ready to affront and learn about it. Look examples about people who don't lose hope and keep trying until they did it, and see that these people are representation of success. See the mountain they've claimed and look to it for inspiration and all they sacrifice.

In conclusion, we come to learn more from our failures and difficulties than from our successes. Failure can bring us to better ourselves and begin our plans once more, this time more wisely. If everyone was to successes in their first try, we would not feel accomplished in the presence of success. The most important message to take from these quote is that after you have acknowledge both why failed and how it made you feel, you must attack the obstacle again with enthusiasm. Success it is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all love of what you are doing or learning to do.",3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,1

I think if we always be doing something we accomplish it no matter what it is. If you keep on doing things over and over and you can't get it aventally you will find a way and get. Also you keep on trying and you got it and you do it over you get better at it. Its like when you were a little kid you try to ride a bike you keep on doing it and try to get it to balance but every one in life falls but we always get back up again.

I think if you are always doing something in life we will always accomlish it even if it is really hard.

Sometimes i have to be home early and take care of my little brothers but if the school board adds one hour and a half hour then my brothers will be all alone.

I disagree that the school board should add one hour and a half hour to school each day because some teachers might have to take care of they're children and they need to take care of him at 3:30 but if the time of the school changes then he will be late to take care of they're children and come 4:30. they would want to quit they're jobs.

Some people are agree with these class, because classes in online it's bennefit and better for students, students can learning more, students can do a better work, and students can have a more time for to spend with the family. If the students will can study in classes online they can have a big opportunities and they can follow his dreams and has the all they want to do or they want to has.

One reason it's classes in online is benefit and better, students can learning more and they can have in the house because they can do a time for make all things they needed make, for example I want to graduate and I want to follow study but it's difficult for me because I don't have time for anything I can't not make my homework, and study for my quizz. I need to work for buy my things, pay my house and my car. It's for these reason that I frefer class online, with these class I can have a lot time for me, and I can make my things and I can do the two things study and work.

The second reason is the students can do a better work, and they can have a better grade. They can turn in a good homework or proyect with more information explained. For example when the students have more time, they can make a better work, because they are enfocus in his obligation like homework and proyects, and they want to be a good student is for that they can do effort for turn in a good proyects with the use the internet. They can do a good investing for make a homework they can find a lot information, if the students are a relax and they have a time they only need to study a few hours no is like in the school. In the school is more tired because they need to wake more early and they need to do a lot homework in the many classes. But if they study classes in online it's more easy not it's very hard like in the school.

Some people say that the classes online it's a lost time the student do not make nothing in his house, when they have classes online they lost time. For example, when they are in the house they play with the cell phone or they are using his phone for other things, and they not study and not learning like in the shool. However, the classes in online is wonderfure because is a way to spend with the family because they can make a day fun with them and make differents things like play football, wath a movie, they can go to the cinemark and other places that they prefers.

In conclucion class online it's benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Because students can lerning more, students can do a better work, and students can have a more time for to spend with the family. This is important and benefit because students can make a lot things, and they have a more time for make a lot things wathever they want. If the students take a classes online this is benefit for them and have a lot adventages, and they can do the both things work and follow study in online classes and they can follow the goals like find a good job and finish his studies.

If we work in groups, we can share information, ideas and thoughts. We can see what its better for our teamwork and the assignment that we were doing in school or jobs. I think the most of the jobs in the real world are in groups, however, when i work in the mechanic shop with my dad and brothers, an i'm replacing a engine, i need their help because it takes strange, agility and experience to replaced it, because it's really hard for only one person to do it, so it's important to learn how to work in group, these skills prepare and help us for the real world by working like a team or family group. The army, police officer and government are some good examples of groups, they work together to finish their work and see the benefices of working in group. Doing work as a team is not a waste of time, we share the responsibilities,so it would not be the much work for only one person. Two or more people is a good combination of beneficial and fast work.

some say that working alone is better then working in group, but they wrong because when we work in groups is more easy by sharing thought with friend and partners, we get to now each other and makes new friends, that is the way how people get better in life by working in groups.

One of my reasons that I'm not against the after school club is because the students can get there grades up and have more practice when you take any test that you don't know about. For my opinion I would like to have this club because some teachers go really fast when there teaching and I can't catch up to them and it's really difficult for me.

My second reason is that students need this class because they want to achieve in life. Maybe someone wants to go to college to learn about photography but the school they want to go to is too expensive to afford like for example they want to go to a well good college but it's to expensive but the person who wants to be a photographer needs to apply for a scholarship that means they need to have good grades, participate in after school activity and much more this is why students like me need to have a after school homework club.

My third reason is that some students don't do there homework because they forgot it at school or they don't remember they have homework. People like me don't like doing homework because it's really difficult and sometimes I need help doing my homework and it would help me have in my school a after school homework club because that would be helpful to me and other students.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.4,1
1008,4D7E52C79A3D,"Does students think that learning from home would be helpful for them? Learning from home won't be as helpful as much as you go to school and learn in the class from teacher. I don't think that students would learn anything from video or online conference because if they don't learn anything while their at school, so how would they learn from home. They might have work at home or at outside, which makes them distracted or disturbed them from their work, and they might have problems with it. Every student has the right to make their decision but this idea won't work out.

Mostly, in every home there is problem which we don't want to share with anyone or we don't want anyone to know about what is happening in our home. Like fighting with mom, brother or father anyone in home or we might don't want anyone to know why are fighting. I mean people have privacy in their life or difficulties which they don't want to share with anyone, and even if they do the work from home it might not help as much as we are in school.

Commonly, every student is not equally intelligent so they can understand one thing in one time. Most of the time and most student take a long time to understand one thing in this situation if they decide to put distance learning then those student might not understand clearly and of course they won't come to school, so they can have a day off.

I mean if a student can't learn something from school how could he or she learn from home.

However, every student want to learn more and achieve something and most of them don't even care. The person who want to achieve something always try their best to do it, but the person don't care would get a chance to not learn. I mean everyone want to relax in home because school work are really tough, but even after that every student try their best to learn and distance learning can't help it out. if you are out somewhere and you're teacher is trying to teach you in online you might not get what they are saying.

However, some people might think that distance learning might help them but if they can't learn in school then how will they learn when they are not in school. I don't think if you are far away from school so you can learn anything from that. Anyway I don't think that students or the teacher might have that time to talk to every student or teacher to ask question or answer them. One teacher can handle a class together, but same teacher can't handle every student differently, so I don't think that this idea would work.",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,1
3223,E19CE100743C,"""Getting something by doing something or doing nothing also bring us something""

We accomplish more if we are always doing something ,because if we do more than what we want or have we will always be growing ,everytime that we do something no matter what it's we receive something back ,many people called ''reward"" , when we want something and we work hard to get that, we create a confidence in ourself's that we now that by doing something we can get what we want and we motivate ourself to accomplish that. we get more if we do more ,but some people think that by doing nothing you can get something back . accomplishment is something that you get by working hard , giving your best ,and by doing something about it , if we dont do anything we aren't going to accomplish anything or get anything in this life .

We accomplish more by doing something, because if we do more than what we want or have we will always be growing more. like one time I remember that I was in six grade and I really wanted to participate in the math competition that Generic_Name prepare every year ,only the fastest student's in math can participate ,so Generic_Name tell us that they were math reviews after school to practice for the competition ,but I didn't have the opportunity to stay in does reviews ,because every day in the after school I had swimming practice and I couldn't skip because my classes were already paid , so I remember that I was sad and I start thinking that if I really wanted to be in that competition I should do something to be there ,I start to wake up two hours early in the morning and I would practice math and also I will go to the library in lunch to work on math exercises ,but that sacrifice was worth it because when Generic_Name make the list for the people that would be able to participate in the competition my name was there. My mom always tell me that no matter how many times you fail in getting something , because the next time that you tried you wouldn't do the same mistake twice and at the end because of your effort and hard work you will accomplish everything that you want to make in your life. that's something I will remeber the rest of my life.

We get more by doing more ,because every single time that we do something ,no matter what it's we are going to get something back ''recompense''. when you take your time to do something with patience , will ,and gratitude that can benefit other people by not expecting something back ,we have that selfsatisfaction of making someone happy. like when you see a poor child walking in the streets ,looking for food in the trash ,bacause he is hungry and he doesn't have money to buy some food or maybe he doesn't have a mom that can feed him and you know that you can make that kid happy by giving him some food , because you have that feeling of helping him and make him happy once. one time I remember that I went with my mom to work , we went to clean a house of a 79 year old woman that the only company that she had was her dog , so I remember that I ask my mom if I can come the weekends to her house and join her during the day , and I didn't know that this woman would became someone special for me. she was very sweet ,kind , and lovely woman that i have ever meet in my life , she use to call me grandaugther and I was so happy to get the opportunity to meet her and when the time pass; her son that lives in Generic_City came to country and decide to take her with him and when the moment to say good bye comes, I was really sad because I would not be able to see her again ,but after she left I would always remember the words that she tell me; ""I'm living ,but dont worry because you would always be in my heart ,and i will always have in present everytime that you spend with me and make me happy."" that day I learn that when you do something no matter what it is you will always receive something back and that something it can change your life forever.

We get more by doing something ,because if we want something and we work hard to get what we want , we create a confidence of ourself, that we know that no matter how hard we have to work to accomplish that ,if we put our effort we can get what we want. like when you are at school and you have alot of assigments to do ,but you still motivate yourself to complete everything that you have to get done and you make the effort to continue until you are done, that's when you realize that you have that confidence of knowing that "" if you purpose yourself you can do everything "". confidence is something that is going to help you in every situation that you are in , it would help you when you are struggleling to take a important decision that maybe it can change your life. I remember when my sister was confused , because she didn't know if she would be able to accomplish the career that she wanted to take in college, and since that day I admire her ,because she believe herself ,she take the career and I knew that she knew that confidence help her to continue fordward and to accomplish what she already know that she wanted ,but at the same time she was scared of taking the challenge and fail. Sometimes we have to take that fear of failling out of our lifes ,and bring that confidence that would help us to belived in ourself's.

Getting more by doing something, is better than don't do anything expecting that we are going to get something.

By doing something we will always be growing more than what we are , we would always receive something back and that can be the happiness of another person's , and we would have that confidence to believed in ourself knowing that we can do everything that we want if we work hard for it. It's important for people to know that in this life they can have the opportunity to accomplish everything that they want tio improved their life ,but also at the same time they have to know that to accomplish something they have to work hard , have confidence, and they get everything they want in this life.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,1
2777,CB892FB55B59,"How do you want people to see you as a good or a bad person? In my personal opinion I want to be the good one; to make it happen I have to show the best of me at the first time. It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change, I think that it is true. There is no second impression, once is enough to show the kind of person that you are. There are three reasons why I agree. I will not be the person that no one would like to believe in, I will not get help from anyone, and I will not have friends.

To begin with, I will become the person that no one would like to believe in. For example, if I show myself as a liar at the first impression, everyone will know that I am not the one or the incorrect person to believe in. Even though I am saying the truth no one would trust me, but the first impression can change it. My mom told me that doing the best since the begining will help me the rest of my life. She was right because of what she thought me, and I apply it in my life I see myself as the person who you can believe in.

Secondly, I will not get help from anyone. In my life I will need help from others because I am not able to do everything by myself. That's why I should make people to see me as a helpful person at the first impression, otherwise I will not get help. I heard someone said that ""what I give to others is what I will recieve back from them"".

What I understood is that if I do not help others, they will not help me. I always like to be the kind of person that help without waiting something back. I think that it makes my impression as a good one.

Finally, I could lose friends or I would not have any friends what is even worst. Since the first time when I

met my friends and showed them that I am the type of person or friend that is always with them no matter what. Furthermore, I have never betreyed one of them but if I've would did it when we met, they already kick me out of their life. As I said before one of the things that can make me the best friend is my first impression, show them that I am loyal.

In conclusion, first impressions are almost impossible to change. However, you can change them but it takes a long time and you will lost your patience waintig until it change. That's why giving a good first impression will prevent problem for you such as; to not become the person that no one would like to belive in, to not get help from others, or to not have friends. A simple good impression would make your life better or would make your life worst.",3.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.2,1

All the students should perform community service because the adults are out there working the whole day and when they come back home they want to drive on a clean community. The students when they do community service they are learning about their future life it is like a job you can't slack off. The adults don't have enough time to do community work with their job and all that but who has more free time than the students or kids . That is not all when we clean up our community our children our going to live in a clean community so help make a better future. The students may this is corny but they know too that they want their children to in a clean community and for their grandchildren. The community service could be any not just cleaning up also help tutor your neighbors child with home work and any thing out side your house helping is community service. You can babysit your neighbors kids and other peoples kids too that could count as community. The teachers could have like a game where who ever does the most community service gets like a prize of the class.

Now lets really talk about online classes, is a perfect solution for students that for some reason they cant go to school in case that they had a car accident they cant walk but they parents dont want them to fail the school year , or they dont feel like going to school thats why online classes are the best choice not only for me for a lot of people like student and parents; I mean school is not that bad at school students can make more and more friends every year online they will get tired if they have to see the same computer and hear the same voice everyday.",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.7,1

Some students want to graduate early because they want to start working and making money.

High schoolers also would want to gradute early to start off with their college classes,colleges classes are hard and some students just want to finish and complet certian classes they want .Colleges give out alot of work and its hard ,and its not a bad idea to gradute a year early just to start off with your college classes .You get done with like three classes and college wont be as challenging and hard. Students just think ahead and take the option of only taking three years of high school ,and it pays off towrds the end.

Other students take the three years because they dont like school and just want to get finished and complet with high schoool .Other students do it because some have to take care of their families or other students had a child and have to work for that child .Everyone has a diffrent mindset and they all think diffrently from one another.

Second reason is that even if students graduated early from high school, students won't be able to take elective course.

Third reason is that some students work during summer or at night time so it couldn't be a good a idea

Some students think that they are waste time in four years in high school. In my opinion is a good idea to finish high school in three years, because the students can take class before school or after school, then, they can graduate in three years instead four years, instead elective courses, the students can take class, they need for graduate, and the students will have more time to go to college.

The students can take class before school or after school, and they can graduate in three years instead four years. The students can come one hour early, before school start, and they can take class every day of school, or they can stay one hour after school to take the class. However, some students think that is tired to come early to the school, or stay after school.

Instead elective courses, the students can take classes, that they need for graduate. The students can use the time, that they uses for the elective courses, they can use it for the classes they need for graduate. The elective courses it does not prepare to the students for college, and the regular classes prepare them for college. If the students finish high school in three years, they will go early to the college.

The students will have more time to study in college. The students will have time to think, what they want to study in college. Also, the students can finish very early their career. However, some students think, they need four years in high school for to be very prepare for college. The students will have time to think, which college they want to go.

I believe that is better finish college in three yeras, because the students get more time to go to college, so, when they finish their career. Then, they can study another career, because they will still young. If, the students stay four years in high school, they will not have enough time to study two careers.

Basicaly students can complete all their schoolworks and learning process at home through different methods like, in this case, the students attend classes form home by way of online or video cinferencing, but is it really good for the students?. Probably not.

It is know that students learn how to be sociable at school, and also they learn how to act at to many different social events or situations in the daily life. For example, we have a group of students, they are all the day working in a classroom with other students and friends that they knew at school; and we have a group of students that take ""school at home "", they do their school work in their houses and they just can socialice with they family at home. How can you learn how to be sociable without socialice with new people? different than your family ?. The answer is: you can't. Talk with new people improve you confidence and helps you to make new friends, and as students or young people, we do not used to try to talk with new people, because we are afraid, we don't have self-confidence, etc. and school force us to be social with our partners.

Moreover, some people claim that school is not a good way to improve your social abilities, but that people passed and important point and is that the school is the best way to improve your social abilities. For example, you (as a student) are working from monday to friday at least six hours per day with other students and teachers in different classrooms, the students aren't going to be the same in each classroom. All these factors made you get used to different personalities or behaviors of your teachers, friends, and classmates. School have to many different people with different behaviors that can help you to understand the way that people act and how to be their friend.

In addition, school teaches you how is going to be your life when you grow up and trains you for that. There are to many similarities between school and a job, for example: the schedule that makes you get use to the early woke ups, the homeworks that make you understand how long can be a job journey, and the teachers and students that represents your boss ans partners at work. All these examples of how school trains us for our future. Without all the training that the schools gave us, it would be a problem to get use to or daily life when we grow up.

All these reasons show us that school will benefit students more than ""school at home"" or ""distance learning"", because it teach us how to be sociable, it develops or social abilities, and it is a necessary part of our training for our adult life.

1974,953BEF800163,"Finish high school one year early sounds pretty good. Students can start doing something out of high school that helps them in the career they will choose in the future. But, its better to finish the traditional four years in high school, because students can prepare more they self before go to college, its too early for students to finish high school at the age of 15-17 years old, and students might not have the enough education that they need.

To begin with, students will be more prepare to go to college after the four years of education from high school. They can prepare more they self and see what they need to work on or what they wanna do in the future. For example, these four years in high school helped me to find a passion about what I would like to become in the future, and also helped me to be more mature and feel ready for the next step.

Also, its too early for students to finish high school one year before, because students might be in the age between 15-17 years old and they may not be that ready to start a responsive life in college. For example, my sister is 16 years old and she's a junior. When we don't have nothing to do or we are having a conversation, I always ask her if she is ready to go to college or at least, if she have an idea of what major she would like to study and her response is that; she's not even ready for her senior year, and I understand her, because that happened to me when I was her age and when I was a junior.

Moreover, students might not have the enough education that they need to learn in high school, and that can be a problem in their classes in college. For instance, I've heard from some friends in college, that sometimes they really lost in some classes, even though they graduated from high school when they were 18 years old. That means, if students graduate in three years, they would be confusing in their classes when they're in college.

To conclude, graduate in four years from high school it feels longer, but it will be a big reward at the end, because students will be more ready to go to college, also they will be in an age where they will be more responsible, and mature. Lastly, they will have more acknowledge in everything.

$100 dollars pairs of shoes. If a guy bought appear of Nike,FIA,Adidas,Jordan,KD or something the guys will get made if there shoes cost more then $300 dollars and it got ruined. The guys hate when people mess around with there shoes and they ruin it. They don't like stepping in mud and they don't doing outside work.

If the guys are going to do outside work they should of bought in less expanse shoes not high price shoes. If they are going to work they should of boughting less expanve shoes like $20-50 not more then that so we could do alot of differnt things. Some people need to know about that shouldn't buy high price stuff they have to buy less its better if they do not buy high price shoes because they can work and bein looking at there shoes everysingle time and saying don't get my shoes dirty.

When teenage kids start work there like some I don't want to work but they should work becuse some teenger are like i want this no i this these expanve shoes. They are really exsenve stuff that alot of teenger want and like some just like to do differnt thing bought things they should not buy. Kids need to work so they now how much thing are because if are just asking and asking for stuff thats not going to work out wall there going to asking for really expance things that would not like.

Everyone needs to know how much things are and work for it and not ask because that is how they are going to value something. If they buy it with there money they will know and how they need too take care of it and not buy high price stuff. They more that kids start working and not asking there parent it would be better because the kids would be done.

I am working and i like to save my money because i can buy stuff that i need or anything but if someone buys me something i am going to value it becasue they took there time to come and bought something for me. like i did i bought my friend some pair of airpod and i bought my self some pair but when i gave it to him i said here is the pair of airpods that i got you for chrismas i wish you the best. It was better if bought him the pairs of airpods and not someone eles. He was so happy that i bought him a pair of airpods and i was his first girlfriend to and know that i am moving i told him and got sad .He told me i am very valued to him because i am all ways there for him and he is alllways there for me too. My vaule is my sister and my friend rj becasue of him i founf my true love. He makes me happy everyday i get to do alot of really differnt expernts and do fun things with him outside the school. He is the best I love him so much in all my heart because of him he has made me happy everyday no matter if i amsad or upset or anything.        ",2.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.5,2.6,1

Acorting to CNN weekly 98.5% of people that go to collage get five times more income then people that dont go to collage. One reason you should go to collage is because you can be more finachely sexesfull another reason why collage is a good chose is because you can learn new things and meet new people.

Also when you go to collage you learn so many things that you didn't know before it crazy! There are so many classes you can take to help you learn new things and be more intelligent over all.

If your really anti social I would get why your scared to meet new people but it's ok when you meet new people and get out you shell its going to be so exiting. and when you meet new people you can get a new friend that you can study with.

I think students can be benefit because they can have more time, if they have job or they need an extra class but, they could not be or stay after school or they just cannot come to school for personals reasons I think those students can be benefit.

First,student from high school much of them have a job and they need take class at home just for three hours and then rest to get ready to their job. They also can have time to do homework it's how it can be easy for them to study more and have a grade and graduate.

Second, if they are almost to finish high school, but they just need a credit and they don't want to be in school just for one class they should take that class online and have more time;

it can be for homework or they go to visit another place but they cannot missing that class because they need that credit and grade for graduation. What about they can not stay after school but they need that grade they can take that online while they're at home.

Third, if the person have deformity they could not walk, or just don't want to come to school for different reason most be bullying, they can be benefit with the online class so they can get they class done and fine what they want to be in their future, also can have their graduation.

I really think those are the reason why they can be benefit with the online classes they have more time for homework, job, rest, and visit others place, and also they get the grade that they need that is how they're benefit.",3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.5,3.0,1

449,21EFAE02832D,"I believe students should design summer projects instead of teachers, what do you think? i believe so and here is why. Most students think more alike other students because most of them have the same knowledge than others but. That doesn't mean that the whole school will have students that could think like teachers. By all means this proves that there is a lower chance those students with high developed knowledge will be the ones doing the summer projects for others to complete. The students that do create some of the summer projects will make sure not to make them to hard or to easy that way the students doing them can surly keep learning during break without stressing about it. The students that make the summer project will also make them easier for there fellow classmates. Some of the students that are doing the summer project could be stressing about it but that also means they won't make it to difficult because they would want to get over with it already and focus on something else to get there minds distracting. So that we they cannot be thinking so much about school. As well as the students doing them won't stress as much about them because they'll know it's not to difficult and can do it any time during the summer, such being the last week or the last day so they can have all summer to them selves. Not having to think about school. When students aren't thinking about school that doesn't mean they're not learning it, just means they're trying to get there head off of something that highly stresses them about a lot of work or having to deal with for a long time and that's the only time they can get a break from it and not stress about school. The reason being of students doing them than instead of teachers they also won't have to do a lot of writing or work for starters. Students will be sure to not make them as long because they know what it feels like to get assigned a long and stressful assignment especially over the summer break that is the only time you actually get a break from school. Students also doing the assignments will help out teachers to also get a break and focus on other important related stuff they have as well. The students creating the summer projects can also be more open minded after doing them and grow they're knowledge as well as learning better and thinking of ideas more often for school. Teachers can review the students work and see how fine they do. The students who do well creating can continue to do so if they feel goo about themselves doing it for the other students that weren't so bright at it can give out ideas and help out the students doing them. I believe other schools and principals will be impressed by having a school with students creating they're summer projects and that is wonderful. I believe that having students create the summer projects is an outstanding idea for the community and school they will think of them differently and have a better picture of themselves. This argument has been good because it will open the eyes of many students and have them be brave enough to put themselves up for the challenge. If you believe students should create these summer projects instead of teachers write your own prompts to see what you guys have in mind. I think my argument is well stated and many teachers will surly think about letting it happen. Don't you believe so as well? Yes indeed you do.",2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.6,1

Everyone has a talent or a skill? do you have a talent or skill that you have practice for or worked so hard for that skill? Well one of my strongest skills is swimming

You know not everyone can swim right well now I can unlike the time I was drowning well from that experience I have learned not to jump in the deep side of the pool. Well I can swim and an important talent to have or else you will probably end up like me but swimming is one of my talents I love swimming and i'm good at it and i learned to swim by myself.

Although talents and skills are nice to have but some times you just have to work for them like if you want a skill that requires a lot of effort then you have to prepare yourself. Practice and practice it makes perfect trust me thats why every one says it, because its true and thats why i'm such a strong swimmer. Every time that I went to a pool or river to have fun with my family I always tried swimming failed a lot but every time I fell I would force myself to get up and try once more.

takes a lot of work and money to be a good swimmer. In the summer I always begged my mom to go to the pool sometimes she took me and sometimes not but for the times that we went I put all my effort into it. Effort, effort is a big part of obtaining a skill. It all just depends on your part of the process. The process mite be long or the process mite be short it all depends .

in conclusion every one has a talent or skill. skills and talents take time, practice, and effort, what talents and skills do you have and if you dont like the skills and talents that you already have learn anther one it doesnt take much.      ",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.3,1

First, when you meet someone and you see how they act you get those feelings about them if it was hate or love. Second, you may never meet that person agean, so the way he act this one time is gong to make you judge them. Third, or even if you see them every day the way they act toured you give you thats feelings that never will Chang toured them or your impressions. Finally,that why you cant Chang your first impressions.

Those feelings that you get turd that person, if it was love or hate is because of the way they act.

For example this one time i met someone and it was my first time meeting him so i did not know what to expect from him. After talking to him i did not like the way he talk or his personality so my impressions for him was not good and i never Chang the idea that i took of him. I never met that person aegean in my life.

3297,E4C49D70C330,"What would happen if the school menu is change? Most of the kid will be upset because the menu have all the delicious food they like. This does not mean this food is healthy.

United States is consider the country were more fast food is distributed and consumed, and also where more people die because of their high cholesterol.

Now a days with all the technologies advantages people is doing less exercise and moving less , for example: We use the car to go everywhere so we walk less ; we do not even need to walk to talk to a person , we can just send them a text ; even to see the weather outside we do not need to stand up ,we can just check the weather in our phone; we have got to a point where if we are to lazy to go to the cinema we can just stay home and watch Netflix,Hulu, Disney or any phone app.

All this is great but at the same time is making lazy people more lazy and more fat , witch is causing more medical problems; like hart attacks , high cholesterol.

In a future if we do not change anything this it will get worse.

A way of helping the future kids like the students from this school would be by teaching them that there is more than fast food , that there is also healthy food that can taste awesome and some even better than the unhealthy food, for example: avocado, fruit juice ,Cesar salad, fish,etc. That all this types of food can create a balance between eating what your body need to work correctly , and what it want to eat.

One way of showing them other variety of food , is by the school menu. The menu could contain food that the kids have never taste before , and that could have less fat than a pizza.

This way when they get older they will not only look for , hamburgers , Chinese food or chicken wings. They will know there are more options that could help them with their body.

And if we do not teach them this habit right now it will be a lot more hard to get them in the healthy habit in the future.

In my opinion considering being part of the school community and thinking about my future and my classmates

I think that including a more healthy menu in the school cafeteria would be one of the best ideas for everyone. We do not want to have any medical problems because of the food we eat.

I believe its had a good positive effect on peoples lives. see it this way, technology helps us so much like buildings cars and airplanes, technology has taken over restaurants in such a way that you no longer have to tip! technology and stores do mix and its just speeding up the process.

Although technology might be taking hundreds of jobs, technology is one of the best things we have in this world. Ford industry is a great example they make their cars using robotic technology! by using these big instruments they are able to make a car every ten minutes, that's incredible, and not just that they have the capacity to sell trucks without specking to a customer, representative its all online no need of customer service. Having to buy parts has never been easier thanks to Ford/store. org get the piece you need the next day. Near my local ford dealer they have a great restaurant where technology is all they utilize.

Who would've known by using technology in restaurants everything would run much smoother, by using technology ordering your favorite meal off a tablet was never this cool. Yes that means there would only be a few people employed and less contact with waiters/staff members but there is a good side, no need to worry about tip, especially no human mistakes, order everything off your finger tips. while your enjoying your meal staff members will have a chance to be doing somethings else unless called by a customer. Have you seen how long it takes to check out in Walmart! thanks to technology now and days?

Have you ever experienced or seen a cashier take a billion years just to scan the chicken your considering purchasing? i have and It was devastating to watch! or have you witnessed a wrong change? things like this happen way to often and if you never noticed it on your receipt you just lost some money. That's why they invented self checkouts to speed up the process of purchasing, thanks to these great machines leaving Walmart was never easier to do. Just scan and go! sooner or later every store in America will have these great machines. Yes they'll once in a while have some bad performance but most of the time there really reliable. Is it weird not seeing a employee in the cash register? yes but you'll get use to it as time continues.

Having technology in our side has made us better and has lighten our sense of being, technology has been so good to us that it has brought positivists in our lives. How stressful would it be for Ford Junior to hire millions of workers, and finish one car every five hours? or opening up a restaurant and hire twenty workers who are rude, lazy to there customers? and last but certainly not least, Walmart having hundreds of workers who take forever to scan and pack your items.

Inactivity in it's own way has a purpose resting or sleeping, relaxing. If you do that you let out that steam. We take a break after working hard on something.

They are many reasons why high school kids need to start thinking about what they want to do for a living. Im going to tell you why it is a good idea for high school kids to have a (an) idea of what they want to do for a living. However, some people think it's a bad idea for them to start thinking what they want to do for a living.

If people dont start knowing what they like at a young age then they will not know what the want to do in the future. We should start knowing what we want to do by the end of high school for many reasons. When we finish high school we should go straight to college so we can study about what we want to do. They're many people in the world that still dont know what they want to do; and that is because they didn't know what they want to do. You should always know what you want to do for a living once your out of high school.

People in high school only think about living life and not thinking about what they want to do fro their life. They're many people in high school (including me) that just want to live life with out a job and just got party. Life doesn't for that way. If you want to work at McDonald, Burger king, etc the you won't be able to party like you want. All your going to do is work, work, and work all day. If you start think about what you want to do for a living right now, then when your older you wont be working all day. You will be able to take a vacation or have time with your family.

Some people think that if you wait until your an adult to know what you want to do, then its better, but thats not what I think. You should know what you want to do by the end of high school. Then when your older, like in your 50s or 60s then you can retire and not bust your butt of working at a minimum wage job for your whole life. Thats my reasons why I think its better to know what you want to do for a living once your in high school.",3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,1
2300,ABA60F0BD289,"How can you build self-esteem. self-esteem comes from achievement. Student's are confident when they have completed their work and their goals' has been reached. achieving work and goals build self-esteem because they learn how to have confidence, self- respect, and achieving goals.

When students have confidence is important because they can turn in their work with out thinking about getting a bad score, Students can put their best effort in their work and they have confidence they'll have a good score. when students have confident they want to participate more in class do class activities, Students having confidence is important because they can have a positive mindset and they have that confidants to teach other.

Students having self-respect is important because they learn how to respect them selves and others, when self-respecting they think about what they are going to say before they talk sometimes students didn't mean to say it in a wrong way do they make them selves look bad and others start making fun of them. when we have self-respect we learn how respect our decision how to talk with manners.

Setting up goals is important because you build off the skills you already know and getting better. when i was in art class i kept getting bad grades and i never thought that i was going get better at drawing, but I set myself a goal to get better at drawing go i started practicing everyday and started to build off my skills and eventually i get better at it. Now i love drawing with a Passion. when students set goals they can get better and achieve more then they can ever imagine they could. setting up goals and achieving is a good representation because it's showing them that they can achieve and do more than they could ever imagine

As you have read self-esteem is build off by effort, achieving goals and having self-respect is how you get better . only when we have self-esteem students learn better in classes because they will putting more effort on activities in school be more confident with answers and not be shy about getting it wrong students learn from studying or from their mistakes.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5,3.2,1

I mean the teacher ask them if they want to work with a group or do it alone but they always chose to do it alone because they don't know anyone in the class or they don't feel like working with anyone that means they wanted to look cool about it. so that would mean more work for them, What i feel that is more beneficial is working in a group.

When working in a group you have less work to do because everyone has a different job to do for example, let's say you have a project and it is a group project everyone has a job to do like one person could be doing research, another person can be working on the poster/PowerPoint,and the last person can be the one presenting it to the class.

people could say that working alone is better and much quite, However working in a group means to making new friend and getting the work done much faster.

Working in a group isn't really that bad you can have some fun when you are working in a group like making new friend asking when they can stay after so you can do the project together or going to each others houses planning on what you should do with your project. But it is really fun when you are working with your friends,Working with your friends is fun because you would be laughing all day and you might or might not get some work done but that just depends on the kind of friend group you have. There are some who would be focus and get the work done but there are others who would be laughing and get nothing done.

people could say that working with friends is distracting, However having to work with your friends would be really easy and fun.

It's much easier for the students to work in group the can get together and work things out with each other instead of them doing it alone and they don't have anything planed like no ideas at a lot then it's good to have a group because they can bring new ideas. New plans like everyone can have their ideas on their project plus it would be nice seeing what the student made see what each student has. It just shows that everyone had different themes of there project. so when you work alone you just only see one persons ideas and that fine but when you are in a group you see everybody ideas.

Other might people say that one mind is good enough, However many minds would make a differences.

The reason people work by their self is because they might think that working in group is too distracting and it's not fun when people keep on talking. But working with other people will help make things faster and fun but also you get to give your own opinion about things and you get to work together plus you get to learn a lot from your group.

For example, If you already know what you want to do it would be easier to apply for collage and you could get a part time job in the career that you chose.

Students would know a lot about the career they want to do. In high school they could research things about their career like how much they pay,the conditions they work in, and if it takes a lot of work. They could also talk to people that are in that career and take academy classes. It would make it easier for the student because they would be well educated about the career. For example, when they apply for collage or a job they could say that they've been studying and have a better understanding of that specific career.

However, that is a fallacy idea because we all know that is not true. Wise people believe that doing something beyond what they have will make them grow as a person, both physical and mentally. Unless people try to do something beyond what they have already mastered, they will never grow, because growth comes from doing something that someone has never done before, it comes from trying out new things, boost up our confidence and makes us progress.

Doing something beyond what we have already mastered, will make us try out new things that will help us move on further. trying new things is the only way we can know what we are capable of. for example, i remember trying out something new which was beyond the things i knew, i felt different and new. the feeling that i felt was growth. Trying is what makes us know who we are and what we are capable of.

If people do not do something beyond, how do you expect them to grow, when growth is defined as making progress in what someone does in his life time. growth is producing new things that has never been done before making someone realize how good it is to do some that is convince and improve in our skills. Not doing something beyond is as good as not growing. doing something beyond will boost up someones confidence in doing things. the ability to try new things beyond what we have already mastered is what we call self-esteem that alluded from confidence. How would someone have confidence when they do not try new things.

Thinking beyond the box , makes some people become dogmatic with affirmative thoughts, because they would always want to do something with diligent. how do can someone expect a person with fallacy ideas become dogmatic? For example, how can someone define a person who does the same thing over and over without changing? It becomes irritating and unpleasant. growth comes from the things that we do beyond what we have already mastered.

Some people might say, "" it is not necessary to do somethings beyond what you already have because, having excess of something is not good.""however, that is not right, we all know that having something in excess will always push us to doing more things. for example, Trevor Noah once said,'' nothing is enough not until you die from it,"" meaning nothing will never be too much. The more we try doing something beyond the more we intend to learn. we all learn from doing something that is beyond our imagination.

Unless we try to do something beyond what we have, we will never grow, because growth comes from doing something someone has never done, it boost our confidence, and makes us become dogmatic with positive thoughts. doing things beyond, will always produce good results at the end, such as, advancement, making progression in our daily life.

2737,C968149003DE,"So many people at my middle school want to start a after school homework club and this because studies have shown that one way to improve student achievement is to start a homework club. Well I think this idea is not going to work because student will think that they will only have to do homework at the homework club therefor when there no after school most kids won't turn in there homework. Also another problem is the volunteer work no kid wants to stay after school to help and if there only teacher I am certain that kids would lose focus. And the subject I

don't think that 45 minute Are enough to learn 4 main class plus the homework that's not enough time to finish homework and learn.

And many people just want to go to this homework club just to finish fast I think that people that really need it should be in this group not just cause they want to finish fast they can do that at home and after school wasting time and the teachers time. This one of the main problems I have with the homework club is that if kids go there they are only go to fool around with there friends. And not let other kids learn and do there homework and learn being a middle school er my self I have seen how most kids with there friends u would think that they are mauter but not as much. But many people say maybe if you let them they will change but so many people have goin't chances but they keep doing the same thing.

As a conclusion I think that this after school program has no use because homework is called homework for a reason and if u do at school they would not do at home when there's no after school so this after school program will not work for many reason like no a enough time not enough focus distractions. And people who just want ot play and not do work and volunteering kids dont want to stay extra and kids won't pay anttion to the teacher. ",3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.8,1

Students might change their minds of playing around in school from visiting this type of job students will see people working hard and fast every single day and getting paid a small amount so students would not want to be working at a place like that in there future so it could pursue them to start putting more effort in school and not to play around in class, and have a successful job.

Some parents don't have money to put their child in school Furthermore there are going to have to work at a hard working job but students don't have to because you have a chance and you got your education so it might teach students to take this advantage to have a success job and not to play around on the other hand teens that don't get their education will work at a place that pay a small amount.

If students don't take their education serious your parents paid the money for your education and if you just don't pay attention and not try the money your parents paid will be a waste because you didn't learn anything cause you goof of and you won't be able to have a successful job so visiting this job will change students thought pf whether they should play around or not so if you take your education serious you can have a job that pays you a lot of money and be successful in life but not doing anything in school won't get you anywhere.

I would right a letter to McDonald because i want students to see what happen when you just play around in school or your parents don't have money for your education because the employees at McDonald work hard but they get paid a little bit but if you take your education serious you can have a successfull job in life so this might change students mind of whether they should pay attention or not and students will take this as a chance so they won't end up a type of job like this.

Activities are or can be educational, many activities can help a lot, on something someone missed or failed a subject in school. It helps the brain work a little harder then other basic stuff that aren't educational. School activities are really educational in many ways, anything that helps or can helps study on anything. Studying is a great reason why we can do fun activities with the subject someone wants to relearn, practices, or just for the feels of it.

Participating on an activities, sports is a great why to participate, not only that is good for the heath, but to socializes. Activities is an easy way to make friends and socializes. Participating in activities can allow to share opinions, or give ideas on something. Participating is a good why to show efforts on something someone is working on in a group of people.

Working in groups, makes the activities fun and more enjoyable. Enjoyable is that someone can talk to their partner or teammate. Being in groups of teams or just a group of people in activites, makes the groups work together. (?)

Not only activities are just to learn and educate, but activities can be fun and enjoyable. Activities can be extremely fun if you give it the efforts of playing, or know how to play. Fun activities can turn into fights or arguments. It's all ways good that we, or someone know how to handle it.

Because for example right now I am in high schools in eleven grade and I dont know what career I want to take it.

I agree with the societies that do students expected to identify a career, at that way they are gonna know what career they want, some students likes more than one career and they dont know which to decided before they graduated..

They are others students that the career that they want it is to expanses and they don't have enough money to pay they can try to get like a scholarship with having good grades and they have to stars in nine grade with good grades and they can apply for one later and see if they can get it.

As we know, sometimes we just dont take bad decisions at work, we also take bad decisions in our personal life, and it is not just because you felt it was right. Every day for some reason your feelings are involve so that makes that your ideology of your decisions change, and lets talk about meet someone or get a new job opportunity, every little detail change the way that you think, feel, talk, and yes the way you make decisions and that is okay and normal.

Make our own decisions is one of the things that characterize us as a humans, our necessity to express what we feel, what we wish, is the thing that have show us what are we capable of make, do, learn, built, invent, all the things that you can imagine in here are because humanity express their thoughts and make their own decisions.

Otherwise you are autonomous and you do not need that someone tells you what to do all the time, but do not take my point wrong, I am not saying you can do whatever you want because sometimes you would need some help and I can give you some examples where and how sometimes you would need help and your decisions and choices can not be just yours.

It can be in a court, your job, school or when you are not an adult, as you can see that there are some places, situations and times you can not decide for you own.

I believe we can make our owns decisions because I know if we do everything according to the rules that are around us, we can really choose our life and take responsibilities for that.

In fact, you are free to take your own decisions and be responsible for them(when you choose wrong) because it does not mater if you take a wrong decision, it matter that if you have the opportunity to try and figure what you want, it is okay to be wrong sometimes and also is wonderful to be right, the important thing is that you can choose because deserve to have the right to build your life, be wrong, learn and be free.",3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.4,1

838,405CEC6E7F5D,"Do you ever wonder if we should choose our own character by trait or let our characters be formed by influences beyond our control? I will argue that, we should choose our own characters by traits and not by influence. I think that we should choose our own traits, because we will be choosing our own fate or destiny, we shouldn't let other people decide our path and make a good character of yourself

Your character is your fate or destiny to choose on what ever path you should take. We all know that we should go to our own path to life and choosing what is best for our lives. You are the only one that can take control of your character and nobody should have the ability to take it from you. The fate or destiny is at the power of you hands and you are the only one to decide on what trait you will have on your character.

Don't let people decide on what path you should take and live with it. We should choose our own path to life and enjoy it. Many people know that we should be yourself and nobody else, we should be the character we choose to be. We all have our own character, we shouldn't influence people because you think that it is better for them. We shouldn't do that to other people because it was great for you, let them decide on what path they're going to take. We should only give them advice, but don't decide for them.

Make a good character of yourself, don't let anyone make you feel down. We are the ones to decide our own path of happiness. We can be many things if you believe that you can achieve it. If you think that this is a better way to a good character, then take it, endure it, make it worth it.

In conclusion, we should choose our own character traits. You might say, ""I think people's influences can be good for our character."" you are not wrong, but not all influence can be good for your character. It is what John Lubbock said,

""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.""

896,44E2726DA1B3,"Your principal has decided all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree because now days all kids do is stay home and be on there phones and do nothing. I know that because I used to do the same thing before and i didn't like to do anything at all but then I started playing a sport and it help a lot but i think that. Participating in a extracurricular activity may help you by staying healthy, get you out of trouble,and get you in a good college.

one example is staying healthy by playing a sport you can help prevent a lot of things like maintain a good weight, and keep you from getting sick. Keeping a good weight is good for your health because it keeps you from getting other diseases,more than 1/4 of the people in the U.S. are obese. Why not start at a young age and prevent from being sick and other things. Another thing that can help is eating healthy, we can prevent sickness to in order to do that you might want to think about trying out a new sport.

Another example is getting you out of trouble you can avoid a lot of drama. I learned that social media can get you into a lot of trouble, half of the time a lot of the drama comes from social media. Maybe if you join a club or a sports team you can think before doing something that can get you in trouble. One time my friend made the soccer team but she got in trouble so they kicked her off the team and she learned from her mistake and never got in trouble again. When in your in a cub or playing a sports half of the time you don't have time to be in drama get in trouble.

Last example is joining a club, working on the year book,serve in the student council and, playing a sport can get you into a good college now a days colleges are looking to see if you have participated in any sports or clubs. When i graduate high school i want to go to college and a study to be a general surgeon and participating in a sport or joining a club can help me get into a college. You meed new people when you join new clubs and make new friend ships. When you want to go into a club or in sports do something that you like not something your friends like or something that can help you in life with.

In conclusion staying healthy,getting out of trouble,and going into a new college can help you when you participate in a extracurricular activity. staying healthy by playing a sports and eating healthy can prevent you from getting sick. Staying out of trouble can avoid a lot of drama from school and social media think before you do something your going to regret . Joining a club or participating in a sport can help you get into the college you want and you can meet new people and make new friend ships.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.4,1
2521,BB430219DBB4,"In my opinion it's not a good idea because in every country in world it's role that student have to study 12 yeaer in the then have to go to college. There is some people in the world that they would like to graduate early because they don't like school the only reason they don't like the school is that they wake up early and they can't sleep. If we graduate on the time then we can do something to the country. it's good if someone want to take courses because they will learn more things they will have more experiance.

In the other country's the rule in schools are every student have to study 12 years, 7 or 6 book in a book, 12 or 14 test two time in the year the one test is in the half year and the other test is in end of year. In other country after graduate every student of school have to take a big test for college or university in this test the score are start from 1 to 400 hundred the top score is 400 hundred if any one get the first position the president will gave him gift and some money also. The most university are 4 year but only docter have to study 7 years.

Our response is that to tell the student who want graduate early that it's not good to graduate early because you didn't learn anything you came to schools to learn something not for time pass. there is some student they are coming school for time pass they want to pass their time if you ask them a question they can't answer it for that reason we have to complete 4 year in high then graduate. If a student graduate early then college and university will hard for him because he did'nt learn the thing that he need it in the college or univerrsity.

Working in school time is not good for student, because he can't learn anything like in the morning he is coming to schools and after schools he is going to work and he is coming from work night and he sleep so when he will study if he did'nt study he can't graduate. it's rule that 18 year or over 18 have to work but someone is in the school and he is 18 it's not to work his family have to support him to study. It's family responsibilty to tell his child to study. when he gradute then he have to work because he dosen't have to study too much because collage is easy that school.

I hope they change the rule that when student finish thire class and pass ESOL than the are graduate, because the student will take the class that they need it to finish high school and they only focuse on the ESOL and the class that they need if they didn't study the other subjects then why thay make the class they make the class to study and learn something for that reason they have to make a new rule.

80,05F30981F3EB,"Imagine if online schooling was offered at every school. Schools are offering online classes for students to attend class. Also schools offer video conferencing online to help benefit at home. This is important because some students are not responsible to get to school on time. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because health issues play a major role through out the school year, students can become smarter by taking time to learn the content, students would not have to stress over transportation.

Certainly some might think staying in the house all day causes bordom to do school work. Others believe students tend to need help from an adult to understand that content. Still others argue by feeling alone will not motivate them to be productive.

To begin with, health issues play a major role through out the school year on students. Students always tend to come to school while they are sick. So that spead germs through out the school and causes major illness. Spreading germs can have someone hospitalized and in bad condition. Which can make students have bad attendince. Also parents would loose jobs to attend to their sick child. However staying home and still be able to do your school work causes less stress. Because it gives student more time to be able to complete there assignments. Another reason way online classes will help out students that are in wheel chairs, crutches, and broken legs. Is they dont have to be rushed, pushed, in the crowded halls. Therefore they feel more safe and have enough space at home. Parents will be able to supervise their child more. An not be worried that something else might happen. Health issues should be a cause of not being able to not attend school if you are able to do it from home.

Secondly students become smarter doing the research on their own to retain the information. Every student have a diffent way to learn. Some students need day's to understand the content. An some can understand the content off the first try. Also some student need to see it hands on then be supervised as they complete the task. Witch is also not a bad way to retain information. If help is needed the video conferencing will help out in the long run. Being able to home relax and still manage to completed your school work motivates the student to remain on task. Another reason why is grades will have a major increase and students would maintain a higher grade point average. The best part of the video conferencing is the student will be able to replay it if needed. Instead of hearig it once in class from a teacher then forgetting the information the next time you have that subject. Apart of life that is important to have is knowledge, so being able to teach and perfect your weakness are important.

Lastly transportation is a mojor problem for students. Some students have to walk, get droped off, or take the bus to get to school on time. Most students are not responsible to wake up on time to catch the bus. The students that walk are stessed, because they have to walk while its raining, hot, ride their bike, cold, and dark. In conditions like that are not safe for students to go through is something happend to them. Most of the time parents have to work and be worried that their child get to school safe. Having the privaledge to be home and do work will prevent fights, childish students, and angery teachers. So everyone would have peace and respect for one another and learn more. There will be no disagreement and aultications with students and teachers. After school students will not have to rely on transperations, because they are already home. Less stress can be taken off of adukts that are nor responsible for you. Having to find transpertation to your destination is worth money and not everyone is forchen to loan out money all the time.

Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because health issues play a major role through out the school year, students can become smarter by taking time to learn the content, and students would not have to stress over transportation. If students was able to stay home and do school work the it would be less confusion in school. Keep calm and remain focus even if times get hard on your shoulders.

While others think that students would not be able to learn as much as they would attending to school. For some this is a big deal while others justify this as a modern way to study. Technology could be helpful for some but not everyone in terms of studying. Most people think that schools should not adopt such way of education. People say that this is not the best way for study. The reasons people say that studying from is not a good way to study, is because students would not be inspired to do their work,not everyone has access to internet,teachers would help the students more in person That through a computer.

One of the reasons people are saying that studying from home is not a good idea that students would no be inspired. Meaning that being studying from home they would not have the same environment as in school. Assisting to school would help students to focus in what they do. They would do better seeing other students working. Walking around school during free time and seeing projects made by others students could help students to be more creative. Talking to others students and sharing experiences would make students to put more effort. People say that an inspired mind creates great things.

Another reason people argue is because not everyone has access to internet. Either due to economic or others type of reasons not everyone counts with access to a computer. Having some students taking classes from home while others who also want but can not because they do not have access to Internet does not seems good. Some students have to work in order to either pay their bills or buy things that they need and can not afford to have a internet source. There could be paces where getting good

Internet connection could be tough because of the location or weather. This issue have people saying that access to internet is a problem when it comes to study from home.

One more reason is than teachers would help the students more in person than trough the computer. Talking to though computer is not the same as talking in person .People say that students would best understand things their teachers teach them in person because they would explain with more details. Some also say that interacting with the teacher would help students confidence and learning. Some teachers have different way to teach and help the student to fully understand the topics. Students would experiment best learning by having their teacher in front of them or by their side.

Meanwhile people still argue about this issue and that should be a way to solve it. Attending classes from from is not alway a good idea beacuse students would not be inspired,not averyone has acces to internet,and teachers would help students more in person. With all said we can conclud that the best way to study is by attending to school and no from home.",3.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.5,3.2,1

I get a lot of work done working alone than working with groups, because when i'm working alone i get in zone in my mind where i'm like super focused. I be wanting to do more work alone and time passes by quickly, this is why prefer to work alone. this one time i worked with a group because we had to be in group's and i barely did any work to be honest, because there was no competition and i didn't feel motivated at all and i still got the same credit as the people who put in all their hard work into that group work.

1098,545E9BF477C1,"the reason i think that we should not have more school time is because some people in school would not be able to keep up with other kids. and most kids get ttired of being in school for six hours imagine being in school for longer then that and even more kids would start going to sleep in school. because they are already tired of all the classes during the day.

with another good reason that i disagree with adding more time in school is because some people have to do things after school like take care of family or go somewhere important and if you added more time then they would not be able to do get this stuff done because they would be stuck in school learning longer then the time they are accually supposed to get out.

i belaive that there should not add more time to school because it would also be a waste of time because teachers would have to do even more stuff done buy more stuff for students and get more work done grade more papers because we would have a longer school time and then the teachers would have to write more speak more and do stuff more then they would if we had only six hours in a day.

with another reason that i dont thing school should not be longer is that it would not only affect the students and the teachers but it would affect everyone because then the whole school board would have to do more work and the school would loose a lot of money because the school board would have to buy more stuff for students and get more things that kids would need to get everything set up good for the students.

with another good reason we should not have longer school cause if we had longer time kids would not be able to handle so much because they would be learning so many thing in one day and then it would confuse them and when they are going to take a test they would be confused because they were pressured to learn so much in a short period of time and they would not like that because they might fail.

Example presidential election,requires someone opinion and choosing a restaurant to eat at and place to visit. Theres good and bad opinion but pick one or two or more but choose one the help you make a great decision.

First many us citizen are required to vote. Many of them would have different opinion about who is the best candidates. Positive and negative opinions would be circulating about the candidates but you can ask more than person what they think about the candidates there be interesting opinion and some not so interesting think about what the many opinion you hear and think about the one the got you thinking the most.

on the other hand lots of people love going out to eat. Many people try new places to eat at some may hear good or bad opinion about a place but until you try it you can't tell your self is great or bad. Sometimes Google lets you see other people opinion the other people leaved about a certain place. to be honest my dad does this sometimes he goes online and search is up the place and then looks at the rate the place have and the comment as a result of the deadly corovirus (Covid-19) lots of people have decide not to travel. But theres certain people that just love to travel many of the occasion people travel to a place because they hear good thing about a place. for example thats how me and my family hear of Lego land my aunt tell my dad that this place was so amazing me and my family we have been a big fan o Lego and we really dint know this place existed.

finally sometimes people have positive and negative opinion about something or someone but is you job to find out the one the makes you fell like ""this is the one"" many people there own believed thats why you may hear different opinion. Have you ever ask for more than one opinions? i actually have that was went i was't sure which suit to put in a red or black suit so ask my mom dad ans sister they tell me the best suit was the black one.

3175,DF23B896A1C2,"American jazz legend Duke Ellington said, '' A Problem is a change for you to do your best.'' I agree with that stamens because when you have a problem it a chance for you to to your best and overcome it. Unfortunately that not the case. Mostly in sports you are driven to do your best when losing. But adults tend not to do there best when facing a problem. You should be always motivated to do your best.

If you play any sports you know that when you are losing you are motivated to do your best. No mater how many points you are losing by you try your best to make that come back and win the game. If you don't win that game you at least know that you tried your best. If you were to give up you would have wondered, if you tried would I have won. This not the only example, for example you boss is about to fire you and try you best to keep that job. There are many more examples you can try to be your best.

Some times adults have to face problem and they don't know what to do or how to face that problem, they think there nothing they can do. They give up form the start they don't try there best when facing that problem. They simply give up. They miss out on that chance. For example, My dad got fired from his job, he was depressed and did not care at all about anything. He did not try his best. he simply gave up. But you should never give up always give it your best no matter what.

Form trying your best you don't lose any thing you only gain something. you can't follow you dreams without trying you best, does not matter what you want to be. you will face problems no matter what path you take. For example bill gates he did not become one of the most successful people by doing nothing. he gave it his best. So why should you not give it your best .

No matter who you are, you should take the words of Duke Ellington and try you best when facing a problem. Does not matter if you are playing sports or having a issue at work. or trying to achieve you dreams . Never fail to give it your best, or you will regret it.

2570,BF01FFEF8CB3,"When you ask for advice, you ask multiple people right? I do. One of the reasons why seeking multiple options can help you make a better choice is because when you ask more than one people for advice, they mostly give you different ideas and the more ideas you get from people the easier it feels to make that choice. Another reason why seeking multiple options can help you make a better choice is that when you ask different people for advice they would give you their own opinions about that choice. For example, if you ask your friend for advice for a choice you are going to make, that friend might tell you something positive about it, in the other hand, if you ask another friend for advice for a choice they might tell you something bad about it which will be way different than what your other friend said. The third reason why I think seeking multiple options can help you make a better choice is because if one person told you a negative advise and the other person told you a positive advise, you could pick which one you think is helpful. The fourth reason why I think seeking multiple options can help you make a better choice is because if you ask a friend for advice they can tell you their personal thoughts about that choice and if you ask another person they might give you their personal thoughts about it. For example, if you ask a friend to tell you if you should do your homework or not that friend might say ""No dont do your homework and lets hang out"" ,in the other hand, if you ask your other friend if you should do your homework or not he might say ""Yes do your homework because if you dont you might get a bad grade"", and then you would have to pick which one is better for you. To conclude, if you realy need advice, you should ask multiple people so then you could get more ideas.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.3,1
3239,E21C97204867,"Changing the cafeteria food for students would be like taking a bone away from a dog. One of the reasons why changing the school lunch would be a bad idea is because, students that attend the school would not be happy with the change. When students are unhappy with changes of the schools sometimes parents can get involved and that brings a bad reputation for the school board. One day I was watching a show and they were making school changes without the students or parents consent and it turned into a big thing. Students were so angry the went on a ""strike"" and refused to go to school.

Another reason why taking away students favorite food would be a bad idea is because students would stop eating at school. For example, when I went to a family dinner they made meat loaf and I absolutely hated it, I couldnt bring myself to finish it and I felt extremely bad but i had to throw it away. Another example is also similar to my last one but, one day my friends and I went to a buffet and they didnt have a lot options to choose from, we ended up getting these wings and it was just awful we could not eat it all. When people see things they do not like then they most likely will not eat it or even try it out.

Lastly, changing the cafeteria food would leave students with less options to choose from. It would be unfair for those who dont like what they are serving and they would have nothing else to eat. Look at it like this, its like when you go out to your favorite shopping store and they have taken out all the clothes you loved so much about that store and they replaced it with clothes you hate. You would be very unsatisfied if that wouldve happen to you. Thats what students would feel if the school lunch were to change.

Some people say that changing to a healthier school lunch would be a lot better for students; Although, this is a good point, its wrong because it misses the fact that some students would be unhappy with this decision. These are some reasons on why changing the menu would be a bad idea for the school.  ",3.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.4,1

The students will have a all year they can use. If they graduate one year ealy it would help they in college or after college, it would be helpful for them in their future job too.

The students will be able to experience a early college, and they will be able to take their time to get everything they need for their life after college, it will also help some of them in the job they dicide to do, they will have time to get more experience for their job.

It will give them the time they need to get the diplomats or the dregrees they need for the careers the will chose after college. for the one who will be working after high school, it would give them the time they need to get to know their future jobs better.

Graduating in three year will help the students alot, it may take alot of effort, but its a gift and they will be the ones to get something out of it, that's why the students should be able to de everything they can to be successful in their ealy graduation programe. They will have to take courses during the summers and probably in the evening, some may not be able to take elective courses, but it will help them alot in their lifes.

605,2DDFC0DFC442,"Highschool is a big step in the growth of students. The step from middle school to highschool is a very diffecult one. As kids start to grow older there minds also change and sometimes the dreams they had of becoming someone or something is different in highschool.

Many young students in highschool don't really know what they want to be when they get older. And sometimes highschool forces kids to try to find the job or jobs they want to do when they get older. I feel like as a highschool student my self, and as an 11th grader I still don't know what I want to be when I am older. I feel like for young adults like me school isnt the only thing they have in mind. For example, I have a lot of out of school activitys that take away from always just focusing on school. Also for highshcool kids relationships can be a hard. They take up all your time and they also make you angry and stressed. And that can also take away from learning and your future as I know very well myself.

As young adults, Students that don't really have the ropes done in our day to day life in highschool I dont think commiting to a career in highschool is a good idea. I think schools should be teaching kids about different jobs and fields they might want to get into. But I dont think forcing kids to make there choises in highschool is something teachers should be focusing on. Instead they should be focusing on how different students learn in others ways. There are always kids that can learn and achive everything by just sitting in a class room and listening to a teacher talk. And there are the kids that can't just learn in a class room. The kids that have hard time at school becasue they have disabilities.

Teaching students in highschool to be succesful is what highschool need to do. I feel like schools mainly focus on getting kids to collage and what not. But some students dont want to go to collage or even get a job durring or even after school. I feel like school should help students become successful in school but not drive them towards anything. Meaning students should feel free to do what ever they want after highschool. And it all starts with teachers asking kids what they want to do when they grow up. And a lot of students dont even know what they are going to do in the next 2 months to come.

Sometimes collage is not what everyone wants. For me I want to take a gap year right out of highschool. And go play soccer somewhere. In my highschool days so far, Highschool was always been hard and its a big step from middle school. The teachers are not really on you as much as they were in middle school. So it makes u feel like u have more time for yourself. And its good in some ways becasue it teachers u how to be indepentent. But also as teachers give u more lead way students become more likely to do worse. They think its just easy to skip classes and not get in trouble. So for me everything that i have explained makes choosing a career during highschool really hard.

All in all students should feel like they have the fredom to do what they want when they are at the later years of highschool with out the burden of everyone around him or her telling them they have to go to collage or that they have to choose a career when they are in highschool.

I think Making studetns choose a career when they are in highschool is not something schools should be focused on. They should be focusing on having kids grow and not having them choose there careers at a young age. ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.4,1
2928,D2EBEB5FDA90,"I believe technology has limitation human contact with other people is a negative effect on our lives. The reasons are,they buy thing online that are not good and they start to become lazy,communicant becomes hard for them.

Purchasing online things are not always great. When you do purchase it online sometimes they don't always tell the truth and when your getting phones or other things like clothes or makeup. These thing you never know if its used or brokering and if someone could of warn it too. Also food that are buy online are not fresh and they could Carey germs. Take for example when you go out you look at the food to see, which one is good and which one is bad but when your online you can't tell what your getting. This cause people to become lazy.

People become lazy because of how much stuff there is on online and games,

TV shows. Therefore people rather watch a TV show then go out with there family. This is bad for people because this can cause people to become depressed,more stress about online chats and what there saying online or watching a TV show;but you wish you could be that person. People will stop going outside. Take for example YouTube, YouTube is the most used media but also there are non-stopped videos they can go on forever and people stared to thing they have to many things to do. This cause peoples communicant with others harder. YouTube cause people to give up.

Communicating is becoming harder for people because they don't face to face talk anymore. Now they use phones more. Phones are used for texts ,calling. So why is communicant important? Communicant is the main thing in your life it brings people together and you need it for jobs. Jobs where you have to work with other people and help people that buy from you. Take for example Generic_Name is the co work and Generic_Name is the costumer,Generic_Name does't talk to people that much because she texts more ,therefore, when Generic_Name came up to her ask for help. She didn't help because she doesnt like talking to people.

Therefore,technology has limitation human contact with other people is a negative effect on our lives. I believe these are the reason,they buy things online that are not good and they start to become lazy,communicant becomes hard for people. Peoples need to use less technology and try to open there self to the outside world and hang with there friends and family or read books.

3611,F3ACD9A99ADA,"Success is about to enforced our self and to accomplish our goals, as I know nobody was born knowing something everyone was born to learn and to fail every time that is possible to learn more However I agree with Churchill's statement that is about the important role that failure plays in the success, My reasons are that we can protrude, influenced others, more personal experience.

My first reason is that everyone can protrude and be proud over our self ,and protrude means to take the best of us and show it, for example, in my case lass year I loss my job because I didn't have enough age to work in the company this year I start my own company and I have my own employees, this is a example how failure didn't take my enthusiasm, and that we can loss twice maybe but not forever because be will be success later.

My second reason is that our attitude is everything we can infused others that have been losing their life and their enthusiasm and show them that everyone can enforced and get what they want,

A example will be my cousin she had been in 12 grade for 3 years that at the first year that she didn't pass her grade herself confidence went down and she had loss her goals, but this year she will graduate because this year she is been preparing to pass her classes and to get her diploma, this is a example of been failing, and failing and then get the success.

Other might say that success and failing isn't good for our society, however I sill disagree because to get success or to win we have to learn from the beginning, my third reason is that with the experience what we have of been losing and failure twice and twice we will know that we are going to do and be successful later. According to a quote that say ''You can loss a battle but not the war'', In fact we can loss everything but not our enthusiasm.

In conclusion, this is why I agree with Churchill's statement that is about the important role that failure plays in the success, My reasons are that we can protrude, influenced others, more personal experience. everyone is exert to failure but what we have to do is to continue and don't surrender don't give up with our goals, always been happy doesn't paying attention to the situation.

2395,B204869FA146,"Is technology a positive or negative effect on human life? Technology is a negative effect on all human life because it is a limitation on communication. With technology there is no talking to others, so you become socially awkward. You would not be able to talk infront of a crowd and you do not go out to meet new people.

People become socially awkward by not having the practice to communicate with others. You can not spend the rest of your life shopping online hiding from people. People who do not socialize hide their face when speaking, they can not even order food without getting shy. It is sad how the world is relaying on technology to do everything for them. Something that is amazing is having someone to talk to in person. You would be able to see their emotions and feel their energy when you are talking to them. People are not their just to listen but to also give advice to you. I do not think technology does the same. It does not ask how was your day or how are you feeling because it is not human it is a robot.

When you do not talk to enough people in your life you start to become shy. You will start to realize that in almost every job you need to talk in front of a crowd of people. Even if you can not do that you will have to because that is part of your job just to communicate. That is why in school they start to teach you at a very young age how to communicate. Teachers asign presentations for the students to get comfortable talking to others. Practice is the best way to handle talking to others because talking through the phone and in real life are two different things. When talking on the phone you do not need to see the person you are talking to or you can even just hang up. But in real life you have to learn how to start a conversation with someone and keep the conversation going.

People do not go out to find new friends. Yes, it is awkward going up to someone and saying, do you want to be friends. But that is where it all starts by making one friend you have achived a lot because now you have a friend that you can talk to and not feel alone. You can not stay at home just being online. You should ask your friend do you want to go watch a movie or go eat. That is better then staying at home a playing games all by yourself. Yes, you can talk with your friends and play games at the same time but it is also important to change things up a little bit. Just once in a while find something else to do rather than sitting at home. You can do a sport. You communicate a lot when playing a sport. Being at home you are just surounded but technology and you would never really get away from it if you do not try. Another thing: making friends on socail media is not the same as in person. There might even be a chance you never meet the person you met online or might not even be the person you thought they would be in person.

In conclusion even though technology is a great way to communicate with others that are long distance. It is still important to communicate face to face. Even if it is just for a couple of minutes you should still have someone to talk to. So that later on in your life if you get a job that involves you talking to a crowd you would not be scared. Also going out once in a while is not bad. You should not just stay at home playing games with your friends asked them do you want to go for a walk then you could talk to them in person. It is always a good thing to stay away from technology just somethings. There are other things that you can do even alone. You can read a book, sketch and color, or even just have a nice relaxing walk just to think. Technology should not stop you from having a good life and communicating with others. Just remember technology to some people is everything but to you it should not be.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,1

Summer projects can be fun, if only they were chosen by students. If the students were to pick their own projects depending on the subject; they would be interested, more likely to do it, and enjoy as well.

teachers spent a whole summer or a school year coming up with a topic for the students to do during the summer. And, it turns out that the students aren't giving it much though or effort towards their given assignment. That can be waste of the teachers time and energy, but if the students were to come up with a topic and idea of their own they would do the project.

if students were to choose their project, they would more likely to do it because its on something they want to learn and their curious. when students are curious they tend to explore their curiosity and be more drawn in the subject and want learn more about it. students can come up with great ideas when comes to doing their own projects. choosing a topic of your interest in a projects can explore students mind, and do the things they would never though of doing.

The summer project can improve your grades in the class. for example a student that struggles a lot in class either because the they cannot keep with pace in class, with summer projects they can work on their own pace. and if students are not great at working in environment full students this gives the a chance to do in depended study. summer project can give an opportunity for students to increase their greats. if students were to chose their own assignment they could at pace that worked for them, and they wouldn't have to worried about due time date. students would have the whole summer to finish the project, and if they did not finish it, when they an entire summer to do it, now that's just being lazy and it can effect their grade.

Subject can have a great impact on the student. If student is given an assignment on a certain subject their is a chance they would start procrastinate or not do it at all.

therefore they would have zero interesting on doing the summer assignment. for example if i had a history project and a science project. And if my science teacher were to give me a project to do a research paper on how gene mutate, as interesting that sounds i would not do it because science does not fascinate me as history.

Being able to choose a project of your own can be fun that way, it gives a student to look forward to do their work and be more fascinated it. Students should design their summer project; because that's less work on the teacher,

it gives them an opportunity to just think outside their box, and they can make their teachers proud for doing their work, so they can look forward a better school year.    ",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.5,1

But being honest is also not good because it can hurt someones feelings and can make them sad and not being honest could make you lose a friend and or make your friend happy. And if your not being honest and the person finds out you could lose them as a friend or they will dislike you a little bit.

But if i could choose both I would because it depends on the situation on why you have to be honest being honest or not honest could make someones feel sad or happy. And being honest or not could make someones day and make things better for them.

In conclusion:I say it would depend on the situation on why you have to be honest or not so that is what I think if you should be honest or not.

I feel like that we do a lot if we are always doing something and not inactivity. while some may argue if inactivity have a purpose in this I think not, I believe that we can do a lot and accomplish more if we are always doing something because you might want different options from different people, two or more people work better then just one, and you don't have to worry about doing all the work on your self and be worrying about finishing it on time.

Firstly, do you think having different options or opinion would help you accomplish more things? In my own opinion I think having a different opinion and opinion is better why, because someone else way might be better or faster to finish on whatever you are working on secondly, always having a second person while wanting to accomplishing something is better. why because one person might think differently then the other. Like if you worked with someone that was form a different country or state and they did the opposite of what you where doing but it was much faster you would like to learn how they do on whatever they did to finish faster. work could be faster and earlier accomplished by doing it and working it out.

Lastly, accomplishing on whatever you may be working on may help you and the person that you will be working with. I think with accomplishing work you could discover something new or something you didn't know about, and might be good that you would like to share it with you priers and other important people around your area.

In contrast, some people believe that that not being inactivity would help you better you self and accomplish more but I think not. Why because, I believe we accomplish more if we are doing something and working on it because it might get you somewhere in life or better you future and help you in the long run. By sitting down and doing some of the work might not get you as far as the person that accomplish it and will be so much better then the person the accomplished some of the work. This is why I believe doing something and learn more will you more and accomplish more in the long run.       ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.1,1
1729,82F9FDBD6F98,"My argument about the 10pm curfew for teenagers statement; is they should have a curfew for teenagers because it can get them out of trouble, and make it home safe and they can get rest for school.

Example of staying out of trouble is you can get mistaken at night; and get hurt just by not going home at the right time. Another example a teenager can be at there friends house and if they leave late or outside with there friend, anybody can be outside and would want to hurt them or there friend because it's dark out, but if you have the 10 pm curfew you can leave without worrying about being in trouble. also can have a guardian to pick you up when its late so this scenario would not happen.

Another reason is to get some good rest for school and have lots of energy. If you do not have enough sleep, but can have the 10 pm curfew to help you to get some rest and will also help you concentrate in school. An example for this is a teenager could be outside and they do not have a curfew so the teenager comes home late. And does not get good sleep or no sleep and goes to school tired and can't concentrate.

A good counter claim for both is you can just stay home and don't have worry about a curfew or going home really late. because if you are scared to go home late or can't get some rest just stay home. You will be more safe home with a guardian or sibling then outside in the dark and not knowing who is outside. And parents should just be more protective so they don't end up going home late. And they can stay home and sleep earlier and get lots of rest for school.

with both arguments i think the best for teenager is that they should have a curfew just for safety reasons. And no parents should be worried or scared for there kids being outside late because there city council do not have a curfew. And another reason is they can get good sleep for teenagers is very helpful for them so they can have a lot of energy and concentrate in class better and get good grades.",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,1
2297,AB86BAABBF68,"It's a good idea for students to graduate of three years of high school instead of taking for years, i think if they have already passed their classes then they would not have to take elective classes and they might be able to graduate early, but if they need more then seven classes then they might do not be able to graduate and they will have to come during summer to complete their classes that they need to pass.

For example if they are still missing some of the work they had to complete at the end of the year they would have to come during summer school or maybe take more classes then what they were allow to be taking.

If they need to complete more work they might come during summer break, i think it would be good if you have all your classes that you need in order to graduate since when you come to ninth grade, so at the end of high school you might just come to skool just for maybe two classes and it would be better for you becase you need to pass all your classes either way in order to graduate.

and you are assigned with seven SOL and one for english actually you have to be able to pass all the work that youre assigned you must complete all these before you go to the 12th grade, because if you dont complete these assignments before thatnthen you will strugle with these at the end of the senior year of high school, but if you complete all your work that means that you are ready to graduate.

For example i am taking four classes that i need to graduate, but i am taking three elective classes because i wanted to learn more, and i did not want to go home early, so i told my counselour i wanted to get three more classes, but it is because i took all the classes i needed to take during the freshman, sophomore and junior year, so now that i am in twelve grade i just have to take just four main classes with are the ones i need in order to graduate.

Even tho it would have been a good idea to come in summer because i can learn more, but also would not be a good idea because then i would not be able to graduate on time, or mostly like i would have to come to turn in the work i did not finish during school year, and that would b bad because i want to graduate on time just like the other people that passed all theur classes so i need to put that effort and see or talk with the teacher and ask them what do ni need in order to pass all my classes if i am missing some work i have to turn it in.

I want to complete all the work due on time because if i do not turn in the work i am assigned to do then that would affect my grades and that will take me away from graduation, wich i have been waiting for since ninth grade,

So i think it is good to complete your work in class, or if you have homework assigned then we must complete it, or like sometimes the teachers put some work in google classroom with dates due, so we must turn the work on time and complete all of it, becase if we do not do it our grades are going to go down and that means we will not be passing the classes that we need to pass and that will not let us walk in the stage

We must complete all the work, if we do complete all that is assigned then we will be good and would not have to worry about our grades because the grades will be good too, that is why i say that we need to complete the work and sometimes pay attention to what the teacher is explaining that helps us to understand and make the work easy, but if we do not pay attention, at the end of the day or at the end of the class we will have problems with the understanding of the theme we have studied in class because we did not pay attention in class while the teacher was explaining.

One of the examples of not paying attention in class is, what is going to come next like we are going to get very bad grades, so we must do all the work listen while someone is giving instructions because that way we would not have problems with anything and when the test comes up we are going to be prepared to take it and get high grades, because we already studied and if we review our work before we turn it in and make sure everything is good and in order so we would get a good grades.

So other reason why we get good grades is if we come to school everyday because if we miss more then ten days we will get suspended and that will mess up your grades because you are abnsent and you will not be able to see or work in the class wich is better because if you do not come to school for couple of weeks then you will not know when you come back to school, you will be lost because you have already missed some of the work we already did while you was not here, so for me i rather coming to shool even though i am sick or something because otherwise i will bring my grades down and one missing day of school will make all my work come down or bring all my classes down because i have been absent and when i come back to school i would not know what to do.

It is good to keep your grades up and stay them in the same level because that will help ypu tp graduate, so one of my examples is if i come to school and complete all my work, then i do not have to worry about my grades, but ut is not only about your grades or what you do in class is also about what we get in the test and that will be product of the work and effort we put in class if we did good in our notes or study guides that means we will be great in the test too because it is the same that we learn in class it is all the same what will come in the test, so we need to stay focused and ask for help the teacher if we do not understand what we are doing in class.

The teachers are able to help in anything we want, well if it is about the classwork because sometimes we do not understand at all but we can review work and try the best for the next class, we always need to make sure our work is complete before we turn it in because if you have a small mistake that will bring your grades down too and we will not pass our classes and make sure complete everything, in order to graduate.",3.5,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,1
3590,F28D4ACF03AA,"I have multiple talents and skills, but my favorite one is skateboarding. Skateboarding is a very difficult skill it takes several hours, days maybe even years to accomplish and learn a trick on a skateboard, but that's why it's such a unique sport and skill. Skateboarding has become a daily activity for me, it takes all my stress and problems away, that's why I enjoy it so much. I skate everywhere to the store, a friends house, and maybe even to school. although I get lots of injuries like scrapes, bruises and many more I still love this sport because skateboarding has taught me a lot like, being able to be confident when i try new things, getting right back up when I fall, and being able to learn from my mistakes. Skateboarding isn't just a sport, skill, activity or hobby it's a way of life and even tho it may not be the safest sport ever it's still one of my favorite skills that I think I wont get bored of any time soon. When I was nine I had lots of friends that would skateboard and I didn't know anything about skateboarding at the time so it was really cool being able to observe such a unique sport. I would always see them practicing and skating everywhere and that encouraged me one day to try it. So a couple days later I went up to my parents and told them that I wanted to try something new and it was skateboarding, my mom said she would think about it because she didn't want me to hurt my self, but my dad on the other hand told me to just go for it and that's exactly what I did. The next day after school I asked my mom if we could go to the nearest skate shop and she said yes. Once we got to the the skate shop I was looking around and i was so confused I saw decks wheels and so much more that i didnt even know about. So as I walked in the guy that was working there asked me ""is there something specific you are looking for"". I told him I was new to skateboarding and that i've never been on top of one, so he taught me what i needed to know about a skateboard like about the deck, grip tape, trucks, wheels, and hardware. After that we got into assembling my first ever skateboard. Once I was done picking out all the stuff that was going to be on my skateboard we payed and he stared assembling it, once he finished we left the skate shop and it was to dark so I didn't get to skate that day sadly. The next day I get back home from school I put down my backpack and I imedietly went outside to try my new skateboard out the only thing i knew was to ride but i imedietly fell in love with skating. Since that day i've been skating every day and if it's not every day it's every other day. ",2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.1,1
3044,D96EF27304E5,"Should schools control how many extracurricular activities you take? There should be a certain extent in when schools can control how many out of school activities your in. The students family should be the deciding factor in whether you leave or not. That is if you start to fail classes, your parents ask the school to take you out of some, or if your attendance towards the meetings look bad. Then that is when the school helps decides what happens towards the student.

First of all, I think it should be a certain extent in what you can enroll for but it should always be up to the student and their families since that is a major factor inn deciding what to do. If the family thinks the child has no time to do homework or study for upcoming test then they should talk to the student about the issue and hear what the student has to say. If the family decides on letting the child continue is upon them but if they chose to take their child out of the extracurricular activities the must notify the child's guidance counselor and notify the main person in the activity

However, if the students starts to fail classes or most of your grades keeps dropping the the students guidance counselor should talk to the student and see why. If they see to many extracurricular activities then there should be a talk with the student to see which ones he can drop for the time until the grades are up. This should encourage the student that if they want to be a part of the activities the they have to be able to maintain their grades.

Lastly, if the child's attendance to the meetings are bad and are inconstant they should not be allowed to participate in the extracurricular activities. The child should only miss up to five meetings per month with out any consequences. By making the child leave the club and notifying their parents the reason why then should the child be kicked out. Without furthermore, reasons the child could be suspended from coming to the meetings for a certain amount of time.

In conclusion, the school should have very little say in the decision of a student being apart of a extracurricular activity. More or less said the families have the most say in the deciding factor unless the students grades are dropping or starts to fail some of their classes. Their attendance towards meetings are bad or if they just don't go to any meetings.

2898,D1A0AFC80A9A,"Ever since, we were kids we started choosing our own character traits. it can be good or bad based of the environment we live in, how we were raised, and personal experiences. But we can always change our character traits, it's similar to an opinion on something or someone. We choose who influence us. we decide if we want to be happy or sad,making good and bad decisions all those are character traits that we choose with our minds.

Lets say you are inspired by Kobe Bryant. You look up to him as an idol because, of what he accomplished in his lifetime. You either wanna be like Kobe or be better than him. That right there is a character trait, the ability to choose who influences us by what they have accomplished. Some people believe we can't choose our character traits because we did not decide nor choose the way we wanted to be born, we did not choose if we wanted to be tall, short, black, white etc.. But, they miss the fact that character trait is not about the things we can't change, its about the things we can change and decide for ourselves to become a better person or be like someone who influenced us.

Choosing character traits is not an easy task for everyone. In fact, adults have a hard time choosing character traits. Unlike,most kids that dont care about the consequences nor judgments, kids usually choose careless traits but as they get older and become adults, they realized their mistakes and they choose traits with precautions. Mainly because adults have a lot of things to worry and take care of, their character traits can cost them to miss out on big opportunities like a job or a promotion. Something we all have in common is character traits, without it our lives would be meaningless we would not achieve nothing big or anything to be proud of. Our lives are based off the character traits that we choose.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,1

I just want to start this letter by telling you a little bit more about my interest towards your company . As a matter of fact, the day I heard about the oportunities our school were giving to some students to be able to visit some companies. I absolutely want it participate, Because I want to develope more practice and skills about the job I would want to have when I get out of Collage .

Farther more, I'm very interest to work for a Microsoft company that has being my dreams sinse the day I started using computers and I would want it create something that can help others and create new technology for future Generations. However in my school theres not a lot of programs or clases about computer management or software programing, that could help me and other students to improve our nolage about computer Software. I would want to learn more and get more experience about crearting and fixing computers.

For sure woking at a Microsoft company is what I want to do for a living. Also allowing me to come and visit one of the companies would help me undertand what I'm going to be facing in the future when I start working for a big company

For example, what is exactly the job I'm going to be doing or what job I be able do enjoy doing , or what is going to take to get there etc.

If you allow me this oportunity I can show you my skills and you can see and judge me by my job or what I can do. I belive I can be caplabe to do very creative work and come up with ideas in a matter of seconds to improve new producs. And this oportunity can help me figure out what other type of work i can be able to do.

I appreciate the oppotunities your companies are giving to our school and other schools in general, but now I would want to know if you could give me chace and the privilege to come to one of your companies and learn more about Microsoft Programing and computers.

1444,6EB1681A5880,"I disagree that students should be required to take an arts as a class but as an elective they can choose between what type of art class that they want to take,for example if a student wants to take a music class as a elective they,ll have to check in with their counselor to see what class that they don,t need so that empty spot can be the elective that they have chosen.

Electives can be helpful to students because it teaches them something new about the history of the different kinds of arts class and help them understand whats going on around the world and teach them how to play instruments and see where the origin is from and how it is played,art is teaches student s how to paint and make clay and shows who are most the famous painters,where they,d come from and how,d they became such great artists. drama shows who are the greatest actors,famous plays and how they became famous.

Students say that an elective is better than it be a required class because its like having free time but you get to do something that you dont get a chance to do and it could be a career in the future for someone who is interested in doing it and sometimes the counselor puts the students into an elective that dont like and its not a required class and if they dont like it they don,t have a choice but to stay in the elective .

Therefore students should be able to choose their own elective rather than it to be a required class that you need to pass in order advance into the next step of life and it will help them learn something in the future and remember what happened during their time in that they spent in that elective.

3629,F4BE7BB77A43,"Tomas Jefferson say is wonderful how much may be done if always diong. And is one of the reason I deagree with Jomas because if the person always doing something learning stuff they never before do. Is wonderful how much the person can be do and learning new stuff if always work hard. One of the many reason of the human is a intelligent,stroong,smart and do new stuff no matter if they are easy or difficult. If they work hard can be do everithing.

For example the human not born with the capacity to walk or speak all human learng how do new stuff not matter how dificult ther are because more do more learng. One of the big point of always do somehing is prepare for life,is not easy but diong something to make sure the person is in the right way is the most important things the person need to know. Teaching personality and work hard is the big stuff, however one point of life the thing come hard but teaching how go and do resolve the problem. Not matter how be is the problem you need to go and do something then make how strong the person are. The person need to struggle with problems but learning and work hard is the main reason why the person is strong. On one point has the access to take something and work on that, but doing something is how learning new need stuff. Example the person who invent the technology they work hard and always do somethig to make they dream to come real and thas why diong somethihg and do the best potential is how make all the stuff of life. The person who study and prepare to make thay dreams are those work and not matter hoe big is the way they make one aesy way to continue they dream.

Doing somethigs always is the reason why the society do big work define new thing new technology new life becuase always are doing somethis. The person not born with all the intelligent not they learn how walk,speak and one point of life they go to school they not know everything. Not they do something the work hard, however a lot person are very smart but they continue to learn always doing something because they want to a better because they want to suppor the world and they family a better place. Likely the most professional always do something to make sure they life are excel of the most difficult piont of they life becuase always work hard and make new things, because not matter how low they education the person take always can be a better person because always try to define the best decition and the best example to the society. A different way to make the personality strong is find new ways to the problem. Life is like a game more things more work more aesy is to make the things.

If the person always are diong something new and the not choose to stay an d the same place all the time. And the person choose to continue doing new stuff and new work they not need to be the most smart person on the world. They need to work and show they can be do,however they walt to be not matter if they how be a stong personality and not matter is they't go the best school or the best college. Only matter how they be and the profession and the work. If the person or the society do somethig they can be the future. For example one day the person get up and choose to do something and make sure they days are very beautiful do new projects they can be came be make they life more aesy to continue. Life and work are like a gardener more flowes the person add more beautiful they came to be is like work more thing you learng more easy life come. one point they persono can't be continue but all the things thy learn more aesy came to be going up.

That why more things do make goals they persons can find, not matter were the person came or were the born always doing something more intellegent the person can to be. However a lot person are very smart but they continue to learn always doing something because they want to a better or find new technology or make a different on this world. One of the big point of always do somehing is prepare for life. All the persons are not the same one they has more technology to they dream,but others person not and this is not one obstacle to make they dream. Because all the time are be doing something and not wait to came things came not they go find and work hard to make all be came to be positibe they not have obstacles they have the strong to be come a better person. And show everyone not matter how difficult are the problem they came be successfuly person. Like Thomas Jefferson say always diong somethings much be done and is true because the person came to this life and learng everything, a lot person move to other place, need to learng need lenguage, need tradititiones and need people is hard but with the time can be learnig everything and continue the life again with need stuff thas is what is important to always diong on and be done what they need to be done and make sure do the best and hork hard and show a good and strong personality. And accomplish more if always they're something on specific point of life can to be so difficult but working hard and with discipline all can be come more aesy and undertake a new dream and new stuff of life can be come the best tool to widely and known as the most expert guidance to life.

111,084763DC1C8C,"Some school district offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. There are three reasons why students may want to take this chance. First reason is that they may need to help there family out. The second reason is that the students don't want to be in school for so long. Third reason is that the students may want to go to college at a early age to get that over with at a early age and get a good financial job. They would be able to get full-time jobs at a early age with a high school diploma.

First of all one reason that it may be good for the students to graduate early because they may need to help out there families. The students parents may work but they need that extra help for their kid. Because, they are not financially good with money. So graduating a year early may help the students help out there family's. If students need to help there families out and they finish with school early they dont have to worry about having to go to school they can just work so that they can help there families out.

Another reason is that the students want to graduate school early because they don't want to be in school for so long. Students sometimes just want to start making money so they want to get over with school. They may have a job but the part-time may not get them a lot of money. So if they finish school in three years they can start working at a full-time job early and start making the money that they really want to make. Students would love to finish school in three years because they dont want to keep on going to school.

Last reason why students may want to graduate early is because students may want to go to college at a early age to get that over with at a early age and get a good financial job. Students may know what they want to become when they are older and would like to start going to college at a early age so it would benefit they if they could finish high school in three years. Also they would have a good financial job at a early age. They can also start living be them self wants they have a good financial job and out of college at a early age. Also would make good money at a early age.

In conclusion, these are three good reason why students would like to finish high school in three years. They can start helping there families at a early age because they may need the help. Also that students may not want to be in high school for so long. Finishing school at a early age they may start going to college at a early age and also get a good job at a early age. They would be able to get full-time jobs at a early age with a high school diploma.",3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.9,1
2328,AD175892EC1C,"Attending school and Attending online classes.

Attending classes from home by the way of online or video conferencing is not a really smart idea. You can learn better by making eye contact, and asking questions from the teacher rather, than just trying to learn online. Education is one of the most important things in our life that we can't continue it in a good way by attending online classes. Attending online classes might look a smart idea for some learners because they might be able to stay home, and study, but there is absolutely a reason that we build schools. Students might get benifts by attending online classes, but not as they will by going to school. Attending school instead of attending online classes have a lot of benefits that can change an idea of attending online classes.

Attending school can give us a freindly character by being able to talk in front of a group of people. When we attend school, we start talking, and communicating with people by the time we get in the bus. We can find freinds, and get help from them when we need. We will be able to ask any question from the teacher at any time that we want, and they can give us the answer without waiting or searching it online. We will get ready for bigger communities such as college and university by attending school. Teachers don't just teach us a lesson, but they show us how to talk in a good way, and how to have a good character in our life. which online classes would't help us in such a way. We will have a lot of events at school that we can celebrate with the whole school. We can't celebrate any event while attending online classes.

Our chatacter, and the way we are is really important, and attending school will help us to have them in a best way. Talking, and asking questions in front of the whole class or several classes will help us a lot to get ready for college, and more other presentations. Comunicating is something that we will need to use in every day of our life. School is the best way to learn how to comunicate. When we go to college or university there will be a community bigger than a school. Therefore, attending school is a very good option rather than attending online classes. School is not just a place to study books, but its a place where we learn how to live like an educated human. Friends are like family. while we are attending school we will make a lot of freinds but we can't make any freind while attending online classes. Celebrating some events will give us the best memory while we can have that by attending school but not online classes.

Attending online classes have a lot of disabilities to teach a student they way they need to be teaching. A teacher can show us how to use a good language with other people but an online class wouldn't be able to do that. A big community like school can make us get used to talk in front of a group of people, while in online classes we are alone. We need courage in order to study. When we answer a question in the class or get a good grade in our class, the teacher, and students courage us but if we get a good grade in online class, there is no one to see our talent and courage us wihtout a small class massege. Attending online class might be good for some reasons. When we are sick or we have a poblem that we can't go to school; attending online class will help us, but not for a long time. Video conferencig has a big different with wactching what the teacher does in class, and what questions students ask.

There is a lot of ways that we can study but, attending school is the best way. Attending school is a complete education than other ways. we build schools because we can understand the importance of studying at school. School is a place where we start how to to earn someting that we want, and teachers help us with that by giving us courage. Attending online classes will just help us read something, and if we don't understand a word, then we need to search online for that either, whcih is going to take longer time than studying at school. I strongly prefer attending school than attending online classes because there are many benifits we can get by attenidg school rather than attending online classes. We can not learn all the good things on online classes that we can by attending school. Attending online classes will be a big process, diffuicult, less apportunties, and there is no one to encourage us or show us what is good for us. Attending school is a best way to have a bright future, a good way to communicate and a good preperation for college and bigger communities.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.4,1

Hearing wisdom from my Dad will definitely make me a better and smarter person. Because it will make me motivated to think like him and be like him . It will also make me work and study harder so I can get to where his telling me to. And not only I could be like my Dad one day I could probably be a better person and smarter person than him. Because my Dad would push me to work as hard to be the best.

Learning new things from someone that has an experience like my Dad can help me have more better ideas about what I'm doing . And it gives me an open mind about new ideas that I didn't even know about. It also helps me create new ways how to do stuff. And will also gives me better techniques and more ideas. So in the future I can try to change and try different things from what I have learned from my Dad.

It's also really important for my Dad to give me his wisdom, Because I can't imagine doing stuff without someone helping me on things that I don't even know about. It just helps me to stay more focus in my work by just hearing from someone Like my Dad. It makes me want to try harder than other people and be better than them. And lastly it will make me think smarter and push my self to be the best I could be.

So I think it's kinda obvious that every person or even smart people needs help sometimes from someone thats has an experienced before. Because by just hearing from them will teach you new ways new ideas and even stuff you didn't even know existed. Everyone is not perfect in this world and everyone definitely needs helps on something it doesn't have to a big thing it can be a very small things.

2179,A2C232F3D92C,"Are you happy with your self? Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" Do you agree or disagree with this statement? I agree with this statement, being yourself and not letting people change you is a great accomplishment. One should never allow someone to change you.

To be yourself is the best way to the greatest accomplishment because people try to persuade you or talk to you about doing something else that doesn't impressed you. You have to actually think about what you actually want to do to accomplish in life. You don't have to listen to what other people say and tell you. Most of the time people gives wrong advice to others. You have to believe in yourself, that you can accomplish greater thing just doing what you admire.

Go with what you think its a good decision for you, either being by yourself or need someone to tell you what to do. Most of time people doubt others. Having a strong feeling that being by yourself is a good decision for you, that a good thing because thats means you have no problems of being by yourself. If you know that you going to succeed in life then that amazing because you believe in yourself . Go with that decision that you think is right and don't allow nobody to make you do something that you don't think is wrong.

However, there are people who think allowing someone to change you can be an accomplishment. Only if it is for the good. For example, if someone is having a hard time being a good citizen and they are always getting into trouble, then yes changing them is a good thing. You can help them out by saying "" what you doing is not a great decision, you should have better choices then getting into trouble."" Another example, is if someone is having a difficult time, you could help them by giving them good advice how to accomplish something.

Being yourself lead to great accomplishment. I agree with this statement. Sometime people try to change you because they thought you couldn't succeed with what you wanted to become or wanted to accomplish. Sometimes being yourself doesn't goes as plan as you thought it going to go. In my decision being yourself and actually knowing what to do is the best decision to the greatest accomplishment.

3664,F5EFA67354E6,"Yes, I do agree with Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's statement, because people do fail over and over again without loosing enthusiasm.

I have good enthusiasm. For example I failed a lot of classes in high school and I had to repeat them I gave all of my best effort on every class I had to take even if I wasn't good at it or if I didn't like it because I don't want to keep repeating them just because I didn't try i have great confidence on every skill I have and i always try to improve them in a better way I ask for help to see what i need improve on and I eventually did get better and it was worth it because it made things much easier i understood all of the problems I had trouble with I brought my grades up on the class I was failing on i mostly got B's on the tests and quizzes it's way better than getting a D I was glad that I was making changes and improvement on my skills it was the best thing I have ever done.

I have dont ever give up, for example one time i remember i had to do make a little video game for my school project and as i was making it i didn't know what kind of video game to make i didn't have any ideas of what to make and i thought of giving up because i didn't know what to make and then i started thinking of making a first person shooting game and it was mostly like the game Call of Duty but i made a little change to it i put in the choices to choose any gun from the previous games it can be a gun from any Call of Duty game i feel like that was a good idea because some people would really like to have some of the old weapons back and they like a game that is boots on the ground and i also made a zombie game mode i put in some better things in that mode and i kept adding more details to the game and i am actually glad that i didn't give up because it tells me that I am not a quitter and that i wont be giving up so easily.

some people would disagree with Winston Churchill statement because they dont believe that failure would consist to success they think that if you fail your gonna fail again over and over no matter how hard you try your always gonna fail i know some people say that because i had a friend that literally gave up so fast it was pretty sad and i kept telling him that you have to keep trying there's no other choice you can do but push yourself and he didn't he just gave up and didn't even bother to try. However not everyone gives up so fast because they believe in themselves they don't loose their confidence even when they are not at their best they still wont give up because they know they can do better the next time they do it you just got to keep trying till you make it.

I agree with having the normal school week because, The majorly of the high school students have part times jobs they work after school and having a nine hours school day would not leave enough time for students to work in a part time job, There are some girls at high school that have babies, and they are paying babysits, with a nine hours school days moms would spend less time with their babies and they would have to pay more hours to babysits, With an nine hours school day the amount of time to study, do homework or prepare for projects would be less then a normal school day of seven hours that can affects students grade.

1541,767920BDAD93,"Wouldn't it be better if you have the option to attend your classes from the commodity of your house? Although some say that distance learning would not benefit students, actually students should be benefited from distance learning to attend their classes from home because it can help students who have disabilities and it can also help students see school from a different perspective of learning.

Those who believe that distance learning would not benefit students have their reasons. They believe students could have trouble with social interaction in the future. They also think that it can motivate students to be dependable on artificial life. For example, my friend PROPER_NAME who rather attend his classes online and also rather spend his time playing video games and not with his family or friends.

Distance learning can benefit students who have disabilities. When I used to live in Honduras, I had a friend called Generic_Name. Generic_Name had a weird condition on her legs, she could not walk. It was very hard for Generic_Name to attend school. Her mother, called Generic_Name, had to push her wheelchair every morning so that Generic_Name could attend school. Our school was about 30 minutes away from home, by walking. During school time, Generic_Name had to push her wheelchair to get to her classes, restroom and recess. Even though, Generic_Name would get ready early in the morning, she would usually be late for school. Sometimes, Generic_Name would not get good sleep, so it was very hard for Generic_Name to pay attention in class. I think that it was not Generic_Name's fault for not attending school on time. I think that people with disabilities like Generic_Name, can benefit to attend classes online from home. It would save them time, so that they can get a good sleep to pay attention in class.

Distance learning can benefit students see school from a different perspective of learning. Last year, my cousin Generic_Name, refused to go to school. My cousin, had bad grades at all of his classes, at the beginning of first quarter. My cousin didn't like school at all. He would usually say that he would always be tired to attend school because he had to wake up early in the morning. My cousin, thought that he was really bad for school. I would usually hear complains of my cousin about the school's free lunch or about him thinking that he was not made for school. My cousin then talked to his counselor about this issue of him not being able to pass all of his classes. His counselor told him that he could attend all of his classes online, so he did. My cousin's grades are really good now, and he also thinks that it was and amazing experience, for having the opportunity to attend all of his classes. I think that my cousin was not bad at school, he was just not receiving the way of education he needed. I also think that people like my cousin, can be benefit by distance learning because they can experience their school year from a different way of learning.

In conclusion, distance learning can benefit people with disabilities, to help them feel that their necessities also count as students. Also it can benefit people who believe that they are not good for school, so that they can experience a different way to learn and feel useful. I think that distance learning can benefit students with this kind of problems, improve and be equal like the rest of the students, regardless their way of learning.",3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,1
2031,9947BA6C3149,"The option of distance learning can be helpful for students in many ways. Internet have the access of having to take classes online or communicating with a teacher. Students can get the same knowledge in school or in their house but easier. Bullying is the major problem in school;however, teachers can avoid bully by having the option of distance learning. Teenagers might be bad influence for other teenagers by forcing students to drink,smoke, or even worse to use drugs. The majority of students have responsibilities to take care of after school, taking other classes online,taking care of their siblings, or have a job.

Even though teachers try to avoid bully, is hard to make sure students are well behave some do not listen at all and not care or some are lazy. Some student's lives are tough for many reasons it can be by their parents that do not pay attention to them, stress by having too much school work, or some of them have already a job, and adding one more by bully, it can bring bad consequences. In many cases students suicide because of the stress, or they are tired of people not paying attention to them, and not care about what happens in their life. They are cases that teachers are aware of bully, but they ignore the fact that the school is not a save place to be anymore and that they are big problems going on at the school and having to deal with it is better than having to call their parents and do something about it. Teenagers do not realized the fact that they can be responsible for someones death and they be can put in jail by many years, and ruin their live by making fun of someone,or punching other students, it can be something silly and that little things can ruin their lives.

Some students might be a bad influence for other students by forcing them to do several things that can bring consequences for the rest of their lives by being in jail,being unhealthy,or change their life in a bad way. In this days is normal or cool for a student to drink, smoke, use drugs and forcing other students to do the same. The ""if you do not do this I am not your friend no more"", or "" you do not love me if you do not this"" or even worse ""if you do not drink with me I am going to tell everyone your secrets"" that makes students be afraid of losing their friend, girlfriend/boyfriend forcing them to make actions that do not beneficial them at any pint of their lives. Teachers in high school are though to students; however, some students do not care about their education at all and they go to school to talk to a friend or distract other students effecting other students education. Some students are always energetic, getting in trouble all the time,distracting other students, being a bad influence, instead of giving them referrals or suspending them it can be recommend to do home school to avoid any type of problems.

It is a good idea to start saving money for college/future and having a job. It is difficult to study or do homework while having a job students get stress and frustrated to have to attended to school and a job. School waste time in lunch or having other activity when students can do all their work in home and a few hours they are done and can take care of other responsibilities. In students houses can take their time and not have to rush in a assignment or in a test, having the opportunity to not get stress over school work. Having to wake up at the morning it is a hard thing to do for the majority of students, not having a good rest at night can effect students by ,grades, not concentrating, falling asleep at class, not paying attention,always been tired,or skipping some classes can effect when they graduate.

In conclusion having the opportunity to do home school can make a big difference in a good way to the school and to the students education. That it is something that can be a easy way to learn and have the same knowledge like the other students, but in easier way. Internet have the access to many apps to help students can be a fun way to learn instead be sitting in a classroom for two hours. Students can avoid the fact that are some students that do not care at all and if they do not care about their live they are more possible not care about other student education.

Some kids were being rude to him some of them even try to bully him,but cause of his attuide no one couldn't do much.

In this essay I will argue about First Impression. Let's said that you go to the store and see something that you fall in love with at first impression and you buy it, but is not what you expect to be as you saw in the store because the commercial lie about the product . Now you don't think the same about the product that you fall in love at first impression.

First, I disagree about First Impressions statement. The feeling of first impressions everybody have it, but is not impossible to change it. I would give you a example of how your first impressions can be change. For example you see a nice car for sale in you way home and you stop by to see the car because you are in love with the look of the car. The owner of the car let you try it and when you get inside, car interior is ruined and a lot engine problems. Now your first impressions is ruined just like the car you thought look nice. Next weak you see another car for sale close to your house, but this time the car does not engine problem and ruined interior like the last car you try. Your first impressions from a car for sale change.

Second, this is my experiences with first impressions. When I was 13 years old I thought that my sister phone have the best camera ever and best software ever. Now in 2019 the new IPhone 11 come out and my first impression with the camera and software was a lot different from my sister phone.

i hope you are doing good as i am here.

i also want to say that i am happy to be a student in your school.

first of all i take a stand on your decision of changing the school food to a very healthier one and say it a very good one.

it's a very thoughtful idea , and it's also shows that you love the school and i appreciate you for such a great idea. it's a good idea because, half of the student have allergic reaction to some food the chief's cook so they rather go hungry or have an empty stomach and if such incident still goes on, student might even pass out one day.

secondly, if we get healthier food, we will be active and our brains will be able to function well as soon as class start. However, having a good breakfast or even any good food to begin your day sometimes help the brain to work very well , and it's also help make the brain be in a very good position of working during the day.

and not only does it work for the brain, it's also consist or contain some particular minerals like carbohydrate, protein, and fat and other supplementary substance that also help for human growth and also help give energy to the human body.

lastly , changing the school food will also will make student that has never tried the school lunch will now want to try it . Moreover, some student order food and have it deliver to the school all because they do not like the school food or allergic to certain food , and if such incident keeps happening, the school food will go waste and it's will make the school loose money.

so therefore, i will end my speech by saying that it's a very good and and a nice decision for having to change the school food to a healthier one .once again i hope you take time from your busy schedule and read this letter. ",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.3,1
2475,B821E1D68BE7,"our big break. Summer is a season with very hot weather schools take this whole season to give students a big break summer is almost 2 months of break .Although some educators feel that the summer break is too long and schools should be year round schools. Which mean schools have one month of summer and a longer winter break. Nevertheless I think schools should not be year round schools because summer have a very hard weather also students use this time to plan some trip with family and friends.

Summer has a very hard weather to even think go to schools. Some day the temperature goes to 96c or more this is to hot for students. This hot temperature will make students swearing a lot and have very hard head hurt during class time level of streets will increase make students get bad grades or be angry all this time. Students who work in hot areas will feel more difficult to do a simple thing than students who work in a warm area . Hot areas make you not focus in your work.

In summer students have 2 months to enjoy make some family trip or things like that .Some students and families take this time to make some big family vacation plan. students wait for this time of the year to do their vacations. Because summer is a perfect time to go to the beach with family and friends or go outside the country to visit other country as we do not have school in summer we do not miss any day of school . trip can take so much time and students think summer is a perfect time to do. In summer students have enough time do anything students want some students use this time to find a job during summer as students do not have school they are more focus making money,so summer is very important to us to have some time with our family or make money.

In conclusion summer is a hard time to go to school but a good time to make some trip or money so the government should not cut off our summer. this is our time this is our big break. this when students can relax for a very long period without any preoccupation about schools work summer just happen one time each year students have to enjoy students deserve it for all hard work than students did in the whole school year.

People should believe that the true self esteem of students are absolutely coming from the achievement only. Because of praising students in a long times, it migt be would make them image anything that they want to do is all for other's praise to them. Also, the achivement of students are only come when they can be self confident to face any hard works. The praise given is something that cannot be stay in one person foever, praise is to support students spirit while they become successful.

First of all, praising students in a long times, it might be would make them think of anything that they want to do is all for other's praise to them. Because students can easily get distracted by praising from others, they could not be focus to be themselves when there's too much praises for them. Students need to remember that people may give praise to bring them up and surely can bring them down anytime. So, students do not need to listen to anybody's praise or anything that is unreal. Otherwise,a better way is students should be believing in themselves that they can do well on anything hard works.

Secondly, the achivement of students are only come when they can be self confident to face any hard works. Students should learn how to handle any hard works when they go out to the real life. They need to facing to real things, real problems and that is how they can be true self esteem. They can't be afraid or lose their spirit whenever they fail. Also, students can be achivement while they know exactly what they should do to reach their goal on the future. Student better know that people only remember to them when they become success, but if they aren't no will care about them.

Finally, the praise given is something that cannot be stay in one person foever, praise is to support students spirit while they become successful. Because the praise from others to them can easily forget very quickly. So students should know the goods and bads of the praise, it could bring students to more success when they know that the praise of people can helps. Students can be famous and getting praising from others anytime when they do something great or they can show people about how well their capability are.

The achivement of people are not coming from anyone's praise, that is about how hard they were try and what were they faced to reach their goal. Also only believing in themselves could bring them to the successful in future. There are nobody can help or follow them until the end of your goal, so they should do their best they can to show their ability. ",2.5,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.5,2.6,1
1568,7820048B53C8,"Dear principal,

You are changing school policy so student that have a C average can not participate in sports or other activities unless the students have at least a B average .I think that students that have a C average should at least have an extra class that they need help in so they can pull up their grades up so the students can participate in sports or activities. If the teachers of the student think that they are working hard to bring their grades up at least the principal should give the students 30 minutes of free time on the activities or sports they want to participate in.

The school should make a contract saying that students that have a C average cant participate in sports or activities. The parents ,teacher ,principal ,and the student should sign the contract .The students that don't even try to work hard to get a B average should stay an hour after school to catch up the work they have been missing. the students that don't recognized that what their doing is wrong and they don't get privileges like other students do.

sincerely, STUDENT_NAME

2384,B106E3896C56,"well to start off i do agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson on what he wrote because in my postion for me it is true like he said ""unless you try to do somehting beyond what you have already done""

you need totry and see how it works out and if you are succesful with it then you master it even more bigger to become even more bigger so that is why i agree with what Ralph Waldo wrote.

one reason why i agree with Author Ralph is beacuase it is true once you mastered somehting you can also do something beyond like bigger. so that is one reason why i agree with what he wrote second reason why i agree with Ralph Waldo when he says ""unless you try to do something"" which i think its true if you try to do something and u make a mistake you can keep trying like lets say you go to collage and you failed 3 class and you give up which its not a good idea because you will make mistakes in life not all the time but sometimes so that is what i think when he says ""unless you try to do something"" means like you at least need to try once and see how it goes. thrid reason is he says you will never grow and what he is trying to say is that if you master somehting beyond that what you have already acomplished and you go more bigger then you will grow because you did somehting on your own and bigger so that is why i think there is a thrid reason.

These are all the reasons why i agree with waht he wrote and why i agree with him like i said you ned to try to bigger things in life and become more succesful and get more better things have what you want like buy a car a house and go on vaction with your famliy and like i said for reason two i said if you try and make a mistake you need keep on trying and become a better person. so that is what i think about what he wrote and why i agree with him.

2899,D1A682106D3C,"It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. Although some people think that a positive attitude will not help a lot help a lot to be successful, actually that is not true. A positive attitude is the key to success because, we can always be out of stress and bad thoughts, we can always have a high confidence about ourselves and for something good to happen, and we can always have a good and friendly personality wich makes others to feel good about helping us and we can use their experiences in our lives.

Here are some reasons that explain why a positive attitude is the key to success. the first reason, is we can always be out of stressand bad thoughts. For example, when we are in the bad situation and we don't know what to do, if we have a negative attitude you will be filled with bad thoughts and anxiety, we can't think properly and find the right solution. The second reason, is we can always have a high confidence about ourselves and for something good to happen. For example, if you are studying for our test, and if you have a high confidence and you are certain that you will pass the test, you will absolutely pass it. And last but not least the third reason, is we can always have a good and friendly peronality which helps others to feel good about helping us. For example, if we have a problem and we don't know how we can choose the right way to slove our problem, when we have a good and friendly peronality it'll makes other people to feel good about helping us, and we can use our experiences in our lives.

We have been talking about the benefits of having a positive attitude and how is helpful for us to slove our problems and have a healthy mind. These reasons such as, first, we are always out of stress and bad thoughts, which makes it difficult to think in the right way. Second, we are always have a high confidnce about ourselves and for something good to happen, which this gives us strength and make it easier for us to solve our problems. And third, we are able to have good and friendly peronality, which makes other people to feel good about helping us, so we can use their experiences, are little details that effects a lot in our lives. Therefore let's put all negative things aside and encourage everyone to have a positive attitude.                   ",3.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.3,1
1611,7AB87BA4342F,"Kids play to have different jobs, but I know, since I was a baby, what I want to do. The world of the entertainment, in special the theater, is something that always catch my attention, thats why I would like to visit the Art and Performance Center.

The principal reason why I want to go is for my family influences, my grandma has been dreaming about me been an actress. I remember going to the theater with her, telling me that her biggest dream is, one day, see me on one of those performances or shows. When I was littler, I use to participate on local shows every summer, her proud smile and happy tears make me feel that I was on the right place, doing the right thing. I know she would be so happy if I become an actress.

Also, the Art and Performance Center has been the place of one of my favorites presentations,""The Rose"", the feelings that the esterpians transmit during the hold act are powerful; they make you feel that you are part o the show, or even better, they make you feel that is not a show. Imagine myself on that scenario with the lights, music, the public, while I am realizing a magnificent performances is something that makes my feel really grate. I want to inspire people in the same way that actors inspires me.

My love for the performant arts isn't the unique reason why a should go, I am a respectful and courteous person; a hardworker which goal is to learn everything about arts. Some students aren't really interested on the place they go, playing around, acting boring, but not me, I am really interesting in this opportunity, in all the special details of the world of preforming arts. From the backstage to the actual scenario, everything would be a delaitful experience for me.

For all this reasons, I would like to go to the Art and Performance Center, seeing all the components and experiences that brings you the fantastic world of the theater.

960,4967076F4E7F,"I don't think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Because when students coming home, they need to do the homework first. Maybe that's day some people have a lot of homework so they couldn't attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. If they could open some video of online then I think some students can''t watching whole video. Because when I finish my homework, I feeling so tired and I just want go to my bedroom or play game, message, Facebook, ... I guess that's habit all students because almost students doesn't wanna be work too much and parent will be for son or daughter spend time for favorite like soccer, bamboo, ukulele, ... If the students might relaxing then I think they will learning better and faster.

Some parent want my son or daughter go to the bedroom early. Because parent can control them easy, example like some students will say I still do home work on the Laptop, but they playing game with friends. The best way is for students go to sleep early. If your might for students sleep early, It really good for eyes and healthy because one young people can sleeping enough eight our every night, you can feel comfortable for star learning better new day. And if you don't sleeping enough, you can't learning anything at school because you always sleeping in classes and teachers always say ''wake up, wake up''. It not good for you and teachers. And when you go home, time for sleep but you don't feel sleep because you sleeping in classes too much. That's why you don't feel want to sleep, and today to tomorrow to whole life, you still don't want to sleep early. Maybe that will be become the cycle in your bad life, If you don't wanna change your style.

I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home is not good. Because when parents coming home, they need talking, do something or have a dinner with family. It's will be better you do a lot homework. If you have dinner every night, you will have a lot of conversation with your wife or daughter, Since you will be know what your family want and your sentiment with family will be better and better.

When students learning online or video at home, maybe they don't understand what video say and if they have a question, what teachers they will ask ? And if everybody have a question to asked teachers, the teachers can't responded the question too much for students. If students waiting for tomorrow go to school, maybe students will be forgot the question they want ask right now.

I think students need learning at school better learning at home. Because one people one idea, that's mean have a lot of answers your guess and you will be know the best the answers from teacher. It'll be helping you how to do work team. Work team so important with students because in your future, labor need you know how to work together.

3560,F1620489BEB3,"I agree that changing the school lunch menu to a healthier option would be a better solution. This could help resolve some problem we have today. The top problem in the world for this topic is that many people in America are obese and numbers are growing. This also helps show a new generation the many healthier option to choose from. What i think the best thing is the amazing new foods and cultures it can be introduce to you. How many people do you know that their or your kids don't eat the school lunch cause of the food almost everyday?

In America we have gone through many tough time's but a big issue that started happening in the late 90's and early 2000's was the growth in obesed. The line for what was good and bad for you was smudged and the only thing that was okay was that it tasted good. That's why schools started noticing a change in peoples decisions for healthy or unhealthy choices. And change if not only a small bit to try and help, but that didn't mean they couldn't bring in their own food. Having a more healthier option would be good for students bodies and a better state of mind cause you know your giving your body energy and what it needs.

We go through life living the way we were raise. That also comes with the food that was given to us as teenagers and kids. All of us have at least one trait that your care giver did that now you inherited, some people drink coffee more then other cause that how they saw life as. Which is why showing kids and teenagers a better more healthier life style early show them better eating options and that all starts with what to eat for lunch at school cause your there for almost half the day.

The best part about eating a healthier life style is that you can try new and better options instead of the same lazy food. Almost every country use natural fresh produce in everything they eat cause of their culture. And showing people that might not like that idea, a food they wouldn't eat but end up loving it is the best feeling. This is also educational cause it introduces students to new culture are the world. This show's how they eat and prepare food in their country and the difference in our own lives. It's really eye opening for some people and it show kids not everything that doesn't look good is bad food.

Having a healthier option for school lunch is good but it take a lot of meal prep and it's more expensive them getting can or frozen goods. Employees that work in the lunch room are gonna have to come in more early to wash and cut fresh fruits and vegetables which means the school is gonna have to pay them more money cause their doing more. And to get the best quality produce, schools are gonna have to pay more money which some schools can't do. But the only thing that should matter is the students not this or that. The problem with schools is that their lowering down their standards with food to get things that aren't necessary. They could be using that money for better food and better silver wear items then what we have now.

Having school lunches be healthier is better for everyone even if it needs time to get use to. A better lunch can show people different and more unique foods around the globe also helps show's that not everyone's different. This also help's show people that there are better options in fresh and natural items rather then foods that have yellow dye-7. This would also help America be the country it wants to be and how Americans want other countries to see us as a stronger, mature, and all around amazing country. And show that this school is ready for change no matter what happens.",3.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,1
2393,B1E1608C016D,"'Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.''-Churchill once said this phrase during WW2 to tell his people that it didn't matter how many battles Britain was going to lose but that they were going to win the war. Personally I do agree with Prime Minister Churchill many times on my life I have fail, and fail again but I got up because I knew that there was a good price at the end. Humans now at days think that life is all about planing the future, and they all just trying to avoid problems, trying to live only winning but to reach success there must be a long journey of lost battles, of big problems but you must stay put because it does not matter how many times you fall you most get up again, and again.

My Dad once told me ''Always try never give up''. Back in 2014 it was my first day on the soccer academy

I been playing soccer as a defender all my life but this time it was my first time training in such a good team I started training every day make some friends too. A few days later the first game came I was not on starting line up or on the bench I wasn't even call for the game I was upset but I though that it was because I was new in the team, or the coach didn't know me well. The next day during practice my coach call me out and told me if you wanted a spot on the team you need to work harder after that day I knew I needed to start training more, going to the gym more often, and I start eating more healthy a few days later during practice I started seeing results I was getting stronger, faster, and skillful a few weeks later I got called for the teams fourth game but I was not in starting eleven I was sitting on the bench the all game I was upset I though I was failure once more but I never gave up and the next day I was back practice, eating more healthy, going to they gym more often. Halfway during the season one of the the starting defenders left the team and I knew it was my chance I started and I play all the game and I didn't just prove my coach that capable more importantly I prove my self. Later during the season in one of the last games in one play I dislocated my arm and that meant that I was out for the rest of the season. After three long months of recovery after was heal I started once again training harder, eating healthy, going to the gym more often getting ready for the next season. beginning of 2015 that season I was chosen as team captain and I played all the games all that hard work was worthy at the end.

It dosen't matter how many times I failed I never lose my enthusiasm because in life we are going to have many failures and we will feel life given up but we most get up and keep going it doesn't matter how many times we lose a battle our main goal must be win the war because just like Churchill failed again, and again but at the end he won the war with his people I also failed in my team again, and again but I won my own war at the end.

I believe that is not the best choose a student's to practice this work to build self- esteem; for many reason, because some people don't has the idea if the student's are agree or disagree this is no the best way to improve in their self-esteem to practice on praising. And other is they need to improve in their achievement, because they are not sure if this come from praise or achievement. Also students they has the last world, if they need to practice the things the some people thinking to the benefit for their self-esteem.

1. Reason some people don't has the idea if the student's are agree or disagree, i think this is not the best way to improve in their self-esteem, because students they believe in praising but, this is not the option to learn in their self-esteem they need to focus in their achievements. even if some people belief on praising,they think this help students to believe in praising i think students believe in this source but is not the principal option to believe in praising they need to focus in their achievements, values and skills because is one the priority and purpose to believe in their self-esteem this ideas must be to help to lean focus.

Students need to improve in their achievements, because some people are not sure if this come from, praise or achievements. I think this are two different thinks, also one is believe in religion, for example: I belief in Jesus this is praise they don't need to compare, but i don't dismiss this idea,because is good idea to students believe in praising. Another is achievement this come from the goals you made and the effort you did it for your accomplishments.

Also students their has the last word, if they need to practice the things the some people thing, to the benefit for their self-esteem, but the two are good idea for instill students don't believe, if this is the correct option, also they need to make the best effort to practice the best way to help their career in the future.

In conclusion the students dont need to practice thing that some people thinks,to improve to help and learn more about self-esteem, this is one the purpose to improve their self-esteem, this is optional in what you believe if their praising or achievements but this two different things, but is good idea learn both for better self-esteem to understand.

1409,6C802D3F5F2A,"One topic that is frequently debated is ""Does true self-esteem come from praise or does it come from achievement"". Some people think, that praise that is given for deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards. They believe that the source of true self-esteem is achievement. I believe that the source of true self-esteem is by praising a student's work because that could help them grow more independent. By praising a student's work, they are going to be able to; work efficiently independent, have a bigger self confidence, and learn better.

First reason, When a student's work is praised that helps them achieve there work more efficiently. It emphasizes that they are capable of working independent and being able to have a good job. When some one is praised for their work, it makes them feel good and makes them want to do more work. A student's work should not get praised for their work if they didnt put any effort in the work because that would just make them want to not put any effort in the work, because they will think that they would get the same grade as someone that actually tried and actually wanted to get a good grade for something that they put so much effort into.

Second reason, When a student has a big self confidence that helps them get their work done more constant and with more effort because they know that they can do it and that are capable of having a good grade. when a student is willing to put a lot of effort into the work. their work should be more praised. praising a student's work can help them have a by self confidence, which can help the students learn more. when a student is willing to learn that is the true motivation that is considered being able to achieve more work and do it more efficiently and with more confidence.

Third reason, When a students is willing to learn a lot and are always on track, paying attention, and turning in work on time. and always putting a lot of effort in school, those kinds should always be recognized and praised, because they show how mature they are and how willing they are to graduate and have a good job. If a student is willing to learn and put a lot of effort in work, that makes them mature because it shows how willing they are to learn. other students dont care if they graduate or not because for them being ""popular"" and not listening to the teacher, and disrupting the class and doing what ever they want it more important than learning and getting an education.

Having a strong self confidence, being independent and willing to learn more are some examples of praising a student's work. when a teacher shows an appreciation to their students it shows that they care about them and it shows that they are willing to help them carry on and push them forward and being their when they need it, and that makes the students want to go to class everyday and want to learn because the teacher is fun and knows how to work with students very well. and that is why it is good to praise a student's work.

754,39F578D9212E,"An enjoyable place where you can go spend time outdoors is going to the beach because you get to do a lot of stuff. For example, you can get to spend time with your family and have fun with them or with your friends. You may be thinking that the beach is somewhere where you can go and come back that same day but what you don't know is that you can go to a hotel and enjoy the hotel and the pool. You can go eat anywhere you want there is a lot of options you can choice from. There is a lot of fun things you can do for example you can go to the haunted house, the carnival, and the art work they have so you can take pictures with your family or other members. The beach is a place where you can go to relax and get sun tan and go swimming.

The reason why you should go to the beach is because you need to have some fun time and not be stress about a lot of things in your life and enjoy the times you have with your family and capture memories with them. One of the most importance part of going is to be able to not be bored at home and do nothing. The beach is a place where you can walk around and see things you haven't seen and also taking pictures of where you have been. You can go to restaurants or you can bring food of your own. You could be able to meet new people you haven't meet before. There is a lot of clubs at the beach you can go there and dance and have some drinks. You could go to the store and buy clothes,hats,sun glasses, and more.

The second reason why you should go is because they have good hotels you can stay in and you would want to pick a hotel that is right next to the beach so you could see a good view of it. There are these bikes you could ride with your whole family and you would all be able to piddle on it or you could bring your own bike or any other stuff you might want to ride. The waves of the beach is cold but it is worth it because the waves are really big and can push you really hard but that depends if you could swim. You could also go to the pool that is in the hotel and be there if you don't want to go to the beach. Sometimes, people would want to be at the beach and stay at the hotel for like two weeks or more but I consider you being there for like about four weeks because you would be eligible to discover new things or see new things.

The last reason would be go when it's 4th of July because when they have fireworks at the beach it looks really pretty and nice. The beach is a place where people could get married or have a romantic time there and they enjoy doing that. There are people that do there shows there like to get money for doing stuff for living. I would want to actually live at the beach because I don't need to go from where I live to the beach because it's really far away but anyways, at the beach there is a lot of great stuff there and nice people and I know for a fact that you should diffidently consider going and not over thinking it.

In conclusion, I recommend you going because you are going to have a lot of fun especially with your friends and family and you would remember that in your spending time outdoors you had a good time. Don't forget the hotels,the food, and the pool are such amazing part of why you should go to the beach.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.4,1
3761,F9DDE725DB74,"To begin with, it is good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early?. In point of view, it is good idea because when students finish their high school in three years, they also can work, and save money to enter college. So it's good for students graduate in three years and obtain their diploma, and start to apply in some college. Also, students can find better jobs with their diploma.

First, it is good idea for students graduate and obtain their diploma because some students need the diploma to enter college. For example, my friend Generic_Name needed her diploma and start to apply in summer to enter at the

Hampton University. Furthermore, students who's want to achieve their diploma in three yaers, they have to work hard. But some students wants to achieve their goals without make any kind of effort.

Second, students can find better jobs with their diploma because if you don't have any diploma you cannot work in a proffessional job where people pay more. For example, my sister Generic_Name have to work after she graduate from from high school, but she need a good job to save money to enter one year later at college and pay her first semester. Instead, some students have to work because they don't have any type of help from their families.

If students have to work is because they want to enter college.

Third, some students cannot finish their high becuase they have to work for maintain themself. For example, my cousin Generic_Name cannot finish his studies because he have to work at 3:00 pm to 10:00 pm so he don't have time to his asignments of high school. Some students can't graduate not because they don't want to, cause they have to pay bills from their homes. Also, they don't have a better job to pay their studies from college and its harder to them to obtain the diploma from high school.

In conclusion, it is good idea for students finish their high school in three years and enter to college. So it's good for students graduate in three years and obtain their diploma. So students can find better jobs with their diploma and pay their studies from college. But, students can't graduate not because they don't want to, cause they have to work and pay bills from their homes. Also, when students have a positive main they can achieve whethever they want, it doesn't matter the situation that you live you can finish your high school and enter college if you work hard.

171,0D00750E249B,"The school should proved a better and healthier lunch menu. Schools cafeterias plans to change to a now school lunch menu. I think is good idea to change the lunch menu.

The school menu repeat the same food every day. For example,the students are boring that school lunch menu don't change the food for a better that the students can be satisfy. First at all,some of the students skip classes just to go to buy good food outside the school. In addition,would be great if the department that make the menus can approve for the people who work in the cafeteria to give a good food that can help student to don't sleeps during the classes and have energy when the classes start and they can put attention. Also,changing the lunch menu the student can attend to the school every day because some of the students don't come to the school because they don't like the type of food that they give. In conclusion,for benefit of the student would be a excellent reason to change the school lunch menu.

In the school lunch menu there are food that contain a lot of grease. For example,that type of food with grease can make the student get sicken. Moreover, the grease can be accumulate and affect the heart of some of the student. Also, there are more possibility the the system of the stomach be affecting,the the amount of grease that is use in the food. In other hand, the grease can make the student be obese there are many case in school there are a lot of student obese because the food that school provide contain to much grease. In conclusion,All the food that is in the school menu can cause several problems for the students.

While other argue that change the lunch menu is a good idea,but there are other argue that change the lunch menu is not a good idea because there are some student that have a favorite food from the menu and they want the menu to stay the same. Although this might be valid, there are several important idea to considered,such as,some of the student pay there food but the food is not good enough. For example,some of the student buy the food in here of the school because they to have energy to made all the classes. So, They don't eat at home because there are not a lot amount of time so they decide to came to eat to the school but there is not a good food. However,sometimes the lunch food is costly but there are time the food is not full cook. In conclusion,the student pay the food to eat because is important to be healthier.

The school don't change the food every weak and same day they have the same food. On the other hand,there are food that are not healthier for the student to consume. At the end, to have a good care for the student there need to be a good food. Althoug a really good food help student to have energic.",3.0,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.7,1

A possitive mental attitude can make you successful but it can also blind you from seeing how you may fail. The idea of being successful in life has nothing to do with a positive attitude or negative attitude its how you struggle to try and be successful and not just say that you will be successful, a lot of people have wanted to try and be successful or try helping by being successful but also fail and their hardwork goes down the drain. You should think about working hard and being the best

Students argue about having afterschool programs because is bored. I'll rather have afterschool programs because is a better way to improve your skills, is easier to do your homework, and it helps students with special disabilities.

One reason why I'll rather have afterschools program is because it improves your skills more than you could ever had. Afterschool programs are reasons why students have been growing a lot this past years. I had a friend call Generic_Name who had really bad grades, he sign up in a afterschool program and in a few weeks, he already had almost all A's. In transition, this is one reason why I'll rather have afterschool programs.

Another reason why I like afterschool programs is because is a easier and faster way to do your homework. I'll rather do my homework afterschool because they can help me and I could have more free time at home to do whatever I want. Homework is good to improve your grades specially if they count as a quiz grade, because quiz grades count as thirty percent of your grade! Furthermore, There's one more reason why i'll rather have afterschool programs than having nothing.

Last but not least, A reason why a like having afterschool programs is because it helps special students who have disabilities. Special students are the same as regular students, but people say that students who have problems or disabilities count as ""Special childs."" My brother had difficulties with his reading because he didn't know how to read that much, he went to a special class and he had improve his reading skills over the past ten years. Moreover, This is my last reason why i'll rather have afterschool programs.

This is all of my reasons why I'll rather have special and afterschool programs than not having nothing to do afterschool. My favorite one is that is easier to do your homework because you will have more free time at home. To get in a program, all you have to do is ask for that program's sign up paper and sign it.

2037,99A3641592CA,"Do you think immagination is more important than knowledge? Why do you think it's important? Let's see why I think it's important! Well think about this you have the knowledge, but you never immagine things that you think you can't do. If you just immagine or think bigger about what you want or what you want to do. One day you will achive your goal or dream.

One of the reason why I think immagination is importantant is that if you don't immagine what you want to do in future as your job or hobby. When your in school your not going to try your best and show effort. If you don't learn anything at school when you are older to get a job, your not going to get the job you want, because wherever you are there will be someone that want the same job as you but trying harder than you, learning harder than you, and showing more effort than you. Which means effort creates achivements. For example, you went to an interview for a job at a store to be a cashier and there are 15 people that want to be cashier. But they only need one. So first they asked everyone what do you do when the costumer comes in. One of them said you have to smile and say hey, do you need help with anything? and you said you continue doing whatever your doing. Who do you think there going to pick? Of course the first one right? because she showed them effort and willing to do the job. That why you have to immagine what you want to do in future and try your best in school.

Second reason is that you have your knowledge, but if you don't immagine or think bigger your not going achive big things in your life. The people who failure in life are the people who quit something one step away from success. That's what a lot of people do. But the people who successed in life are the people who took the step that a lot people quit which the hardest step to take. For example, you want to start a company, but the people around you said that your not going to success. Although they said that you started a company anyways. After a month no one wanted to invest you company. You kept asking people to invest your company. So one person did, with that money you payed the bill. Then nothing happened to your company. But if you stop asking people when no one wanted to invest your company your company would of been closed. So you have to immagine thing and use your knowledge to achive them.

Third reason is you have to immagine things as your dream and get a lot of knowledge by learning at school. When I was little I wanted to become a docter when I grow up. Then I started immagining to help and more stuff. When I go to school. I told myself you have to be good at science, math and other subject to become a docter. So I will have knowledge about things that you have to know to become docter. so you have to get a lot of knowledge to achive the things you immagine.

So I think immagination is more important than knowledge. But knowledge is still really important. I feel like everything starts with immagination first. Then you go to school to get your knowledge increase every year. You work really hard to make immagination becomes reality.    ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,1
1290,62EDBC22A953,"I think that success, are composed by failures, but not for everyone.

Success are for a better life, but to have a better life there will be always complicated things(FAILURES), that may be you will want to stop doing that thing that is going to help you to succeed.

The important role of failures on success is that, if you don't fail once you will not learn; failures plays that important part in success, learn is based on what you did wrong, I am saying based on wrong because If you did something wrong before, you learn that part, What do you did wrong? and next in the future you already know what you did wrong and now you will make it right.

Now, sometimes we give up so easy on what we want or on what we are fighting for, some loss the enthusiasm for the success and others not, I agree with that, some think different and if you think different about the failures its going to help you to make that success. I'll say, once my aunt told me ""Believe in what you can do, and not in what you can fail on"", she hasn't never give up on what she can achieve in her life. For example I'm from Generic_City and all my family are Hispanic and our home language is Spanish, and speaking English its not easy for me, but I never thought that I was going to be able to speak it. I told myself that everything its possible in life, you born for a purpose, not just because your mom wanted you to be born.

There was a time, I got stress, anxiety and depression. I was failing in school and I felt so sick that I was giving up so easy and fast. Failures comes one after one, and after one, that I told myself ""You are going to be okay, and you are going to do what you like and succeed and make your parents feel proud of you"". I started to think positive, and do the things right, nothing last forever, I got rid of my depression but still with stress and anxiety, but from there to now it doesn't mean nothing for me. Failures can cause a lot of things like, feel hopeless, loss enthusiasm and giving up so easy for those who are weak, but if you are strong enough to believe that you are going to make it you will make it, you are going to have your levels of hope, enthusiasm and faith high that nothing will stop you to succeed.

Failures are more challenges added to your life, to be in the top of the mountain you should hike until you can see the ocean behind the mountain. There will be more than failures, there will be big obstacles and some times people will put traps in your path.

Some people will just want to see you fail in the field and some will be happy to see you in the top of the mountain. Some people fails in their path because they dont understand the meaning of the failures.

In conclusion, I agree with the idea that Success consist of going from failure to failure, even if you loss your hopes or enthusiasm you got to keep going in your goal to succeed.

More than 50% of people, I will guess, fight for their future they put all their effort to succeed and if they can, we can. Failures come as a good parts of success to set it down and success in life.",4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,1
2544,BD0CEEC9B429,"People should seek guidance from experts and authorities about lifes important matters for many reasons, there are some emotions following our own decisions whether is right or not, people shouldn't always follow their heart and do something it could cost your life in the future. Another suggestion is asking for help to those who knows how to guide and gives ideas to people following their own decisions . Having some different types of ideas from different people or culture it can help us to work and do better in life because life's important matters. It can help our sociatity do better for our new childrens and the anyone whos around in our environment.

First of all, some particular people sometimes shouldnt always follow their heart or emotions whether is right or wrong we can always seek for help and do what we like to do in our daily life. For example, the other day I made the worst decision because I didn't have the courage to share my thoughts with anyone in my family or friend about quitting my job or not. I felt like if I suggested to ask someone to help me clear my mind I was going to do better now. Next, later on I saw my manager and told me they had a better job position for me with better health insurance plan. In this case I feel that seeking for guidance is not always a bad idea, is the opposite we can help each other. I made a bad decision for not comunicating with others about my problem whether to stay or leave, what i did it was left the job.

Secondly, in many cases we think we know a lot, but in reallity is that other people can help us to do and give new ideas in our life. Than, If I want to change something in my life I have to love myself more and have the courage to comunicate with others and let them know what I am thinking and expect a better results. On the other hand, making your own decision can also help you to be succesful about life and not depend on others. For example, someone whos expert, can let me know and give me some advices about a proyect because they alredy know it or went through and have lots of experiences in that area. I always believe imformation is important if we working as a team is the best for the human we get to know each other time and values. Although, everything works best when we seek for a true guidance.

To conclude, in many cases people are really succesful because they met or know someone from different culture and shares different types of ideas. In this world we live in many times this is the best way to work with as a team by seeking help from experience people and open up our brain more to understand the problem and to move on forward in our life. If woman and man work together life's gets easier because we all putting our effords so that we can have a better tomorrow for our lifes and childrens.

Hope is so important in peoples lives because lets say if someone loses they child and if that person losses hope they would stop looking for their child and if they stop looking for their child they will never find him or her.

In my opinion, prompt is a something positive attitude in our life, and I agree with that because we have to learn how to be prompt. Next, a positive attitude is the key to success in life because we can go far with that, for example: In my future I can get my goals and get everything in my life, that is, a car, a big house, and things like that. Then, I agree with the positive attitude, that is something important to do and to have a better life. Also, my idea is, if we are positive in our life, we can get a lot of success with our goals.

I can follow these list to see what I can do to a positive attitude.

Do something interesting

Search something new

Talk with a trust friend

After that, some people disagree to a positive life because I think they don't have something in their life, like a good future. Something interesting,

a prompt help us to do everything fast but is not good,

because can happened something bad.

A positive attitude is the key to success in life because that's something important we have to do, if don't do something good we don't have a better life, we stay in the same way, for instance, each day we have to know new things, for this reason a agree whit that. I believe to success in life because I can get a lot opportunities. In my opinion to have a positive life, we can relax, read books, listen to music, go out to walk or talk with some good person, these can help us to forget the problems or something bad in our life. Be positive is something can help you to do what you want in your life, and other people to be positive.

Later on, my mom said, I have to be always positive and try any thing new, I think that is true because some times when I can't do something, I try do it like 3 times, after three times I can to everything to myself, so that's a good idea to try every thing what we can't do.

1391,6B3B3CB54EB9,"My opinion about conserve energy and resources.

I have two points of view, the bad and the good one. I think this is a good idea but, it has bad things.

I think if we want to conserve energy and resources we just need to have four-day school week. Four-day school week can be benefits for the people that have to work everyday, but it has a disadvantage and is that we are not going to learn to much like a five-day school week.

My first point of view is that this can be good for many students. If my school follow this system can work for many students that have to work every day. First reason is that they can have one school-day off so they can go calm to the job. They can have that day off in school and job. Second reason is that, this can be good also for those students that skip school everyday, maybe if they know that we just got four-day school week they would want to come to school. Third reason is that teachers can have more time to work on projects and do all that work that they have to do.

Second point of view is that is system can not be a good idea. First reason is that students would not learn as much as five-day school week. Second reason is that is going to be tired to be ten hours of school. Third reason is that two more hours of school are not a good idea for those that have a part-time, they would not be on time in their jobs. Two more hours of school can be frustrate for many students.

My position on this issue is that this would not work. First reason is that many students that have to work they would like to go to school beacuse of two more hours. students that have to work start they shift at 5 pm and school would end at 6:04 pm, students would skip the last classes. I think if this is to conserve energy and resources it would not work beacuse is like they are adding part of the last day of school to each day so like the same think.

My conclusion is that is not a good idea my school sould not approve this issue. This like the same think as five-day school week. If they don't add two more hours this maybe can work, but I think this going to be hard for students and teachers. With this system we are not going to conserve energy and resources is going to be the same thing. ",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.3,1

When you confront your failure you have to be conscious for what you doing. For example, you can't repent because you do what you do for a reason. In other word, people don't never have to give up they have to fight and have always the enthusiasm to be what are they are. Although, when you failure make you think more straight and clearly. That teach you to be a strong and continue struggle with your life. In fact, I always have my enthusiasm up even if I failure because that make me more comfortable to who I am and don't be scare to confront my problem. There are many people that scare loss they enthusiasm just because they failure. Failure don't make make a you a bad person, It make you to understand that in the life have down and up emotion. However, we choice ""what we want to be and we do what we want to do""

Therefore, Winston Churchill want to people be happy. He want to people understand that they don't have to loss they enthusiasm don't matter what. On the other hand, I agree with him because if you have the enthusiasm you can handle your problem and be able to solved it. In my opinion, Winston Churchill have throughout for many things and he want to other people be strongly and never give up like him. People have to consider that not always will be easy to don't have any problem or other thing that make you to do thing that you don't want to do, but you always have to be with the enthusiasm to confidence. Despite, it hard to always have the enthusiasm to confront your failure, but you have to be strong and continue for what you have been done. In life you learn a lot include your problem, your failure. Even though, you never have to give up because you will have a future that you want to know and live with your family, have good time. The enthusiasm help you to reflect your ideas and make you to do the things that you scare to do. Make the success strong with you enthusiasm.

In conclusion, never loss your enthusiasm because that help you to be strong. Confront your failure with all your enthusiasm you have to demonstrated that you are more strong than your problems. There are many ways to be success with your own personality you can focus on what you propose, being strongly and confront your failure. Finally, ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". Don't be scared to confront it. ",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.6,1
3271,E353A05E7C8C,"Many school have partnership with local companies and organization allow student to do there community project and just to help out. Local work places like a store and business. Student don't have to work there for like 9 hours insensate they will work to hour a day. If the work fro along period of time they will have an headache because they are not use to it. When i said community project like write an article about the company. Also help out is like if they need wood the students will give them.

One way i think student should not work in a company is because the side effect is student wouldn't do their home work , they will not attend in class on time and they will not study at home. What if the student did dome thing wrong there parent have to pay for it or the school. If the machine cost 10000 that is expensive to afford.

3891,FF66DA76E15F,"Even though imagination is more important than knowledge, thinking in a creative way is better than learning something from somewhere. Yes, imagination is more important than knowledge because it's letting your brain think more about the things that make you happy the most. Also imagination is like thinking outside of the box (to me), but I try using imagination a little more than knowledge. Although knowledge is not as good, but some people prefer knowledge instead of imagination. Imagination helps me become more creative and open to myself because I let myself imagine, then let my mind speak free and be creative.

Becoming more creative and open is really good, knowledge does not give me the opportunities to do so. Knowledge does not let me be as more creative as when I'm imagining, therefore I have to start imagining. I think that imagination is a better way of saying art, because I'm thinking of things that may not even exist in this world. In that case, imagining is creative, artistic, and beyond, so that is why imagining something is better than knowledge to me. Imagination makes me passionate about what I want to do and accomplish it.

I've always dreamed of opening my own interior design company. That designs furniture,planing notebooks for office workers, etc, that are for houses, offices, and dorm rooms. All of that was because of imagination, I wanted to accomplish that when I graduate from college. Imagination doesn't just help me with what I want to accomplish it also helps me decide what I want to be when I grow up. Otherwise imagination would've not gotten us to where we are right now.

Finally, Imagination is something that brings people together like art and creative things. It also brings us joy and things that we don't really imaging on our daily bases. Although, knowledge is not important than imagination I still think that Knowledge can be used in someway and help me with something. Therefore I thing that imagination is more important than knowledge because it help me with my daily bases work at school, home, sports and all kinds of other things that I do.",3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.3,1
3893,FF7698C3CC8B,"Imagination is a thing all of us have some persons have more imagination than others, but I think we all have it some where, like my mother say ""if you don't have imagination you would not be successful"".

I agree with what the scientist

Albert Einstein said the imagination is more important than knowledge because you can have more fun, and you can discover a lot of new things, also you can enjoy life more.

To begin with you can have more fun because you can be really entertained while creating new things like when you start a new project you can have a lot of ideas, and you can enjoy explaining them, or drawing them, you can have fun too when you are making those ideas come to life because you imagine them just how you want them, and you can have fun too by learning in the process something like you may not know, and you can apply them on your project just by using your imagination because you are the only one who knows how you want it.

Also you can discover new thing maybe you would not Know is the thing that you are creating could work, and there you can discover a lot of ways to work more well, or you can also discover, and learn more thing like what to use, or how to put thing right, but thats not the only thing, for what you can use your imagination for, you also can use it when you are drawing or writing histories like when you write you can discover a lot of knew words, or when you are drawing you can discover where you can put lines in the right spot, or at what measure, you also can discover how well you can draw.

Finally you can enjoy life more because you would not be so stressful, and you can enjoy imagine, and in my thoughts when you imagine you are in your own world you can imagine what ever you want, and you would not be worry about what the people is going to say about you I think I'm an example of it because I like to draw a lot and when I'm thinking about what I want to draw I always forget about everything, and I really enjoy drawing, and I also like to go out a lot because of that because when I go out I see a lot of thing and when I want to draw I always imagine them, and then I draw them more colorful than how I saw them and I really enjoy it.

In conclusion imagination is more important than knowledge you can have knowledge but if you don't have imagination you won't see life the same because when you imagine you can have more fun, see life different, and you can discover a branch of new thing you wold see life more colorful, and you can also enjoy life more how I already say you can have knowledge, and you can have and do a lot of things with it but if you have imagination you can have the whole world just by imagining.",3.5,2.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.2,1
1450,6F3C318ED62E,"Of course that i'm agree with Churchill's statement, because for to have success or to be successful in the life you need to have many failures. No one is perfect and you don't need to be it for be successful. This quote reminds me when my grandfather used to tell me "" Son, if you wanna be someone important on the life your gonna have ups and downs, don't matter how many failures your gonna have, but however, in spite of everything your gonna achieve your goals and dreams without matter what other people says about you, the most important is not loss the enthusiasm"".

I think that if you do your best on everything and you try to do it better always your gonna achieve your goals. You don't need to do it perfect all the time, because despite everything you always gonna have a failure but that doesn't mean that your gonna stop try to do your best or your gonna loss all your enthusiasm, it's mean that despite of each failure your gonna follow your goal. No matter how many times you need to do it, just try it!!!.

The failure plays a important role for be successful, everybody has ups and downs, for example:

In the school, if you have a test and you were studying for that test but you fail, don't stop just try it again and try do it better the next time.

For a job, if you are searching a new job and you completed many applications for any job but no one is requesting you for a interview, or unfortunately, you not were accepted on that job, don't matter, you will find another job, just don't loss the enthusiasm.

In a relationship, if you like a girl or boy and you declare your love at her/him but you not were accepted for her/him or what's more worse she/he doesn't like you, don't be sad you will find the right one for you.

In a career, if you wanna have a important job like lawyer but you have a failure in the progress, don't loss your enthusiasm you can try with another profession like nurse or another that you like it.

In the life, i say in the life because i have a stepfather that he always says that he is right all the time when it's not true but he never want to accept that he are wrong and that't a problem, because if you never listen at the other people that are right then your gonna have a failure in the future, for the same reason that you thought that you were right when you doesn't.

Be successful in the life is not something easy at the contrary it's hard because in the progress you always gonna have many failures, but however, nothing is impossible in the life with enthusiasm and to much effort you gonna achieve many big things, always fight for your dreams and goals. Remember nobody is perfect on this life and you are strong and intelligent don't matter how many troubles or failures you have just try to do your best and fight for everything that you want.

In conclusion to have failures is not bad at the contrary is very good for you because you learn more about how to do it better the next time. My mom always say: "" Each failure it's make you more strong and more intelligent "", and the truth that's true, you never gonna learn about your error if you don't have a lesson for to learn but everything without loss of enthusiasm.",3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.0,3.5,2.9,1
145,0B00BC4CBABC,"So if it has come to a point that you don't have to make decisions on your own, even if you have what ever it takes to rule the whole nations, what would you do?. Nothing?, or run away to where you can make your own plans?. NO!. I strongly agree that, people should make decisions on their own.

Making decisions on your own can make you stronger. For example, when i realize i was failing my science class. I took a decision on my own by telling myself; i need to pass this class for the rest of the quarter. And i'm doing great now because i put in my mind with all my strength, focused and i'm doing more than amazing. If someone gave me that decision to pass that class, i wouldn't be able to, because i haven't made my mind up to that and maybe i don't or not into that class.

Secondly, you know your challenges to your decision that you make by yourself. For instance, i tried out this year for the school soccer team. I knew it was only 2 option: either you make it or you get cut out. So, me knowing that made me work harder when i get on the pitch. I get pains in my legs when i get home but i also know that, i have do it again tomorrow so it makes me do extra work home so that i won't be ill but be in shape for the next day.

Lastly, sometimes we make a bad decision which help us learn. To prove this, 3 weeks ago, my mom ask me to clean her bathroom for her, also i had a club to attend. Because i knew going to club will be fun and meeting new friends so, i told my mom i'm going to the club instead, and i will clean the bathroom the next day. And so, i went to the party. A friend of mine was a drug dealer: i didn't know, and he was wanted my the police. He came to the same party and we were sharing the same table. We were drinking, chatting, eating and having fun. All of a sudden, we saw 3 police men that came to arrest my friend but because we were sitting together; we were all arrested because him. If i choose to clean the bathroom this would have not happen to me. The lesson that i learned is that; i don't need to follow my decision every time, and also know who hang around with.

As a results, making decisions on our own can make us strong and focused, know our challenges and also learn. If all this ability only get reviewed when we make decisions on our own, why should we seek for guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters?. Let's people take decisions and do stuff with their own mind set.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.3,1
645,31B604C7D90F,"Should school cafeteria change to a new, healthier lunch menu, for students? In this essay, I will argue why school should not change to a new healthier lunch. School should keep the same lunch menu because students will lost their favorite foods, students will start to pack their own lunch, and foods will be wasted.

Reasons why school should keep the same lunch menu instead of changing to a new, healthier school lunch menu, because each students have their own favorite foods, such as Chicken Sandwich, Pasta Chicken, and Tortilla. Futhermore, Tuesday is my favorite lunch day because it's Tortilla's day. Tortilla, also a healthy food because it have a corns, meats, tomatoes and other vegetables depend on what we like. For me, when I get to eat my favorite foods I feel blessed especially when I'm hungry.

These days, there are many restaurants out there like Mcdonald, ChickfillA ,and many more. Hence, instead of paying for school lunch that you don't like people can just bring their own lunch from home or from outside. It's better for people to buy foods from outside rather than buy foods at school and wasted. Sometime home foods are cleanier than school foods. Students might consider bringing their own lunch. The good thing about it is we can choose what we want to eat.

Every type of foods are expensive, we the students doesn't want to waste it. Thinking back to the poor people outside there craving for foods, I felt bad for them. In contrast, it's hard for us to eat the foods we doesn't like even if we are hungry. If the students doesn't like the foods, they might throw away, or not purchasing it. The school foods will be wasted, and at the end they will throw it away too. Providing students favorite foods are important, students will eat and school will not suffer from wasted.

School cafeteria should keep the same lunch menu. Some says, healthy school lunch are good for students health, but they are wrong. If school principal continues to change school cafeteria plans, students will not be happy and might start changing school for a better lunch.            ",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.4,1

Sometimes when the teacher tell you to make a project and tells you that she's going to put groups to work you know that you don't have to speak by yourself because you know that your friends will help you to make it together. I think that work with someone else helps you to relax because sometimes you don't know something, but you can ask your friends if they know and they help each other, but sometimes it's better to work alone because no one distract you and if you have friends that would be distracting because if you trying to make your work and they playing aroud that will be extrecing even that you know that it's going to be more hard to finish your work you feel relax because everything that you doing its right.

Everyone has problems in their lives even if it's a small or big issue, everyone wants easy fix problems but sometimes having them can give people chances to do their best. Being in a big issue where people don't know what do to, they will have to take chances and having to think to get out of the situation.

For example if someone forgets their homework at school some choices are to print the homework at home or at a library. Not knowing what to do on a homework is never good but trying your best, even if it's wrong. Duke Ellington is right because taking chances to do your best is great and you never know if something you made or done could be used in the future. Every job have situations for example builders may not have the materials that are needed, or teachers may not be able to read the handwriting.

People who do parcor have to do their best to not fall off a building and if they are in a situation where they can jump to a different building or thing they might have to take chances and do their best to get to the other side.

I believe that peoples always try to overcome in life, that's why you always have to try progress in life and grow up and not be an conformist. because you always can be better in life. We have the ability and the opportunity in our hand.

First , never stay where you are, always try to do something else and try to get more experience, always try to overcome in life,because you can always try to be bigger, and bigger,and try to dominate other things because you have the ability and the opportunity do grow up and never give up easily and if you have the opportunity to grow you will do it because never let opportunity get away from you chase the opportunity to be better and to master other things.

I believe that you always have the ability to chase your dream and if it is not enough you can find more and you can get to your where your limit is. I think that all people have the potential to follow and surpass them abilities and if you already dominated your, you can find and try another one don't stay with the same one because there are always there's a lot of things inside of us that we don't want to take it out of them but if a person take it out he can do things that non one can believed, because it still inside of them you know that you have capacity for that but you don't want to do it.

all people make them own decision but some of them don't know what's them capacity is. Sometimes they don't take the opportunity they just throw it on the trash.

Like the feeling of a person they don't fight fort that they can be a big house a lot of money but they can't feel the love that someone has for them that's the one that a person has to recognize they stay in the same place without doing anything they know that they can change that make that happen. But they can change in like and they can grow up.

As a person we have to respect each other, make decision on life to grow as a person be a good person in the association take care of my and my family respect my family, be respectful with everyone. Be clean be a good person help someone make a man as a person having good attitude be as good person with my mom.

3002,D752DF2541DD,"Dear Principle,

changing the policy is a good idea, because many people have c average, and if they play any sports, they might get a lower average than a c. Also they have to focus on their school work first than the sports, and like I said before playing sports might get them failing. Also, if nobody is making a change, on their grades than maybe she could change it but, meanwhile she should keep it to a b average to play any sports or to be in any activity, the students are going to try their best at making good grades to play sports. It is good in many reasons to keep a good average, because then they get their report card or their progress reports and they see that they have a low average, it is going to be because they are focusing to much in their sports or activities. The principle should first see how the students react to the changing, and if it works than, yea keep it, but she can always change it. It doesn't matter if they have a high C, but then need to have a B. Most students would argue about having to study, but i think its for their own good, also the school will change, for example, the school recognized for having a C average ad letting them play sports or do any activities, that could change if the students try hard enough and change the C to a B, then the school will recognized by having a B average on, most of the students.

The reason that its best for students to have good grades, its because also at the end of the year if they don't have a good average, they will not be able to pass the year. Back to the point it will be challenging, but I'm sure the students that love playing sports or being part of school activities, those people will actually try and make those grades, but if for some reason, those people who tried their best, like they went to tutoring, did all their home and school work, and turned it in, then you might want to check in with his/her teachers and see if they want to let them participate, but everyone can make at least a B, not an A but a B, because we all are very smart, some smart as others, but yes I'm sure, it will all work out, but if they keep on complaining, and they don't actually try to do their best, and they slack off, go to sleep in class they you won't see a difference n their grades, then that's their lost, because we want our school to be recognized, with all of out players with a B. one of the reasons why i want the students to have a good average, its because, those who want to succeed will try until they get it right, but if you are the person who doesn't care, then whose fault is that?

So i would like to have that policy. As i told you before, everyone is smart enough to pass their grades, even if, they don't think so.

It wont be so bad, either, to try your best at school, even if you just do it for sports, but i you were the type of person that was failing, then now you can say that you are passing all of your classes, don't think of what other people have to say, just do it for yourself.",3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1
3219,E17E9E75ECEB,"It wouldn't even matter if the school lunch changes to healthy food. Even until this day they still don't change to a heathly choice. Students has tried to make the school lunch meals change, but there wasn't any difference. Sometimes the studentst doesn't make good healthy food choice there will be times that the lunch menu will have healthy choices and not so heathly choices. For example: the lunches gives us two options one is pizza and the other rice with chicken, students will definitly go for pizza.

It would be a good idea that the school lunches menu changes to a healthy menus. We do need to consider other students and their eating habbits, most students doesn't even eat, they even go a whole day without eating. If the school were to change the unhealthy food they should get rid of pizza, hot dogs, and chicken nuggets and make up for potatos with rice and chicken, a nice pasta salad with tomatoes, onions, and, spinich. Some students are vegan so maybe they can have a veggie burger anything with veggies. If that's the case to change school lunch menu, the school should consider about how and where they should spend money on things like changing the floor tiles it's unnecessary it could have been for something better. No one really cares about how bad the school lunch is, it's not worst thing in the world. Anyways thats why us students have to be smart and bring our own food to school like most of them do.

In reality, it really doesn't matter because students still eat school food, some students do complain about how nasty the food is but they still won't bring their own food how logical is that. To be honest there are sometimes good lunches like we said before it's not best thing in the world. So it's okay don't waste on changing something when you knew it could of been done from the start. Just bring your own food from home and you won't have worry about the school menu. ",3.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.3,1
994,4C17DB6FF2DC,"John Lubbock quotes on choosing your own character or letting influences form your is a passage I can live by.

For the reason of it being actually true because, sometimes things you see throughout your life would change your character. The people you look up to can can your character because you want to be just like them. but sometimes its not always a good change sometimes you can have a bad influence.

Things you see in life can change your character. Lets say you are in the streets and you get into a car accident then you are gonna have a chance to be afraid to drive a car. It can also be changed by a bad experience, lets say you are in an abusive relationship after that relationship ends you would think every girl/guy is an abusive person.

What if you are living in foster care and you never get adopted you will think that you will never among to nothing and be nothing your whole life.

The people you look up to can have a dramatic change in your character. Let's say your father is your biggest inspiration you will want to be just like him when your older and follow in his foot steps. But, if your inspiration isn't anyone in your family but it is a famous sport player you will grind your butt off just to be in the same team with them and hopefully play along side with that player. Newer influences these days are trough social media and movies and in my opinion those are the worst ones because they usually trying to sell you something or market something to their audience.

Sometimes its not always a good change sometimes you can have a bad influence. Having a bad influence can lead to a lot of trouble and you can even end up in jail for it. Let's say you look up to your father and he is a very toxic person and a violent person and you end up like him that's not a good thing. Also something that can happen is that you look up to a very bad very disturbing person and he likes to hurt people and then you start hurting people because you want to be just like him. Depending on who your inspiration is it will develop the way your character comes out.                  ",3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,1
3168,DEDCC703F6FC,"Some school districts offer programs that allow high students to gradute in three years instead of the traditional four years. In my opinion, I feel like it is a good idea for some school districts to allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years.

The reason on why I feel like it is a good idea for students to graduate early is for Job oppurtunity, Entering college early and also Moving other places and starting a whole new life without no worries on education no more. Job oppurtunity's will help you out to save money, working on what you like doing and also find some jobs can help you get into college if you are interested. For example, I am studying about autotechnology and it is my second year doing it. My plans are to continue working on cars and hopefully find a job at a dealership so I can learn enough at college.

Another reason on why I feel like allowing students to graduate in three years instead of four is so that they can start off there future earlier than others by attending college. Entering college early is a good thing because you have some time to pick and decide on what you might want to study and learn about so you can get your masters on it or so that you can finish early and move onto what's next on your accomplishments in life. My school has the option to do Dual Enrollment which basically means starting college already and getting already college credits and still having to be in high school.

Finally, another reason on why I feel like graduating high school earlier than others is to have the chance to move to another country or state and start a brand new. Starting a brand new life can become very hard and very stressful. Starting a new life moving somewhere else means finding a better job oppurtunity, finding a olace to live in your budjet and also finding new people to hang around with but in my opinion at the end it will all be worth it. Some students are already looking somewhere to move on there own or with a roomate because they might be having problems at home that they don't want to deal with. At the same time of moving to another place you have to make sure that you are ready on what's about to come into your life. For example, paying bills, paying rent, house supplies and also if you have a vehicle make sure that your payments are on time.

In conclusion, I feel like allowing high school students to graute in three years instead of the traditional four years is a good idea. Job oppurtunity, Entering college early and also Moving to another state or country in my opinion are one of the main important things to focus on after finishing high school.",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,1

But how will this program help both the older and younger students? Well, I will be telling you three things how this program is helpful for the older students and younger students.

First thing is, the younger students will want some help from the older students because they know more than the younger students and it would be a great help. If this program is still going than more and more students will start joining in and they can start forming groups and they can each work on something different.

secondly, this program can be very helpful by teaching students that are getting poor grades or poor scores on their test they're getting. Students can even donate binders,books,folders,crayons,pencils,pens,paper,etc. Even the students themselves can start their own fundraiser by making food and can raise money.

lastly, This whole program can be very useful for the community and helpful for the students. This is why this program is so helpful and important for us student and adults

3424,EAEE04B1F712,"Scientist Albert Einstein once said, "" Imagination is more important than knowledge."" I agree, why do I agree with scientist Albert Einstein. When you use your imagination,

you can create it in your mind first, you can invent it, you can make the world a better place with it.

First, when you use imagination you create it in your mind, you can go to your happy place and just build it you see how it's. Your brain helps you imagine it right, for example in the game called Fortnite, you imagine what you want to build before you build it and how it's going to look like. In knowledge you just know it you can't make it more beautiful. When you use imagination you can see the problems that might happen when you are trying to build something in your mind. That's why imagination is more important than knowledge.

Furthermore, imagination can help you invent stuff like flying cars. I can use my imagination and and think about what can i do to build a flying car and boom! now you know how you can build it. You need imagination more than knowledge. I am not going to say you can't build flying cars with knowledge but, with imagination you can make it better. Imagination is literary a image in your mind, its like you drawing the things you want to invent on a piece of paper, and just adding some colors to it. In knowledge it's like you knowing the answer to a math question or just about any question.

Finally, imagination makes the world a better place, how does imagination make the world a better place. Well it has a lot of reasons but the best reason is, it makes people happy if people are happy then there is no violence in the world. If we don't use our imagination there would be no light bulbs or nothing. If you dreamed about something, with your imagination you can accomplish that dream and make your life better, and maybe that dream was you becoming a teacher than you're making your life better and the world a better place.

To conclude, scientist Albert Einstein said, ""imagination is more important than knowledge ."" and here is why with imagination you can create in your mind first, you can invent it, you can make the world a better place with it.

1377,6A00BED6B62D,"Do you think it is a good idea for students to start their career such a young age and stress about it? I will tell you guys why it is not a good idea. Reason number one students can feel a lot of pressure on them. Reason number two students still do not know what them want to be yet.

Students can get a lot of pressure because students have not found out what they want to do in life. Students can get over welled so easily. Students think about it to much what they want to be when they grow up. Especially freshman they just stated school they do not need any stress when it comes to think about their career. Freshman do not what they want to be yet. They are just new kids that have just stared high school and they do not need to think about it yet. Students already have enough stress and, they do not need anymore of that. Students already have stress from school, sports, home problems, and the list can go on.

Students still do not know what them want to be yet. It is hard to find something want you like to do in life as your career such as a young age. Students may thing they have found the one that they really want to do in life but, they change their mind and, they what want to go for the other career. Therefor, students need more time to think about what they want to do in life. It takes time to think about what students what to be to grow up. There is a lot of things to do for your career so students just have not found the right one yet. They need time to make sure what they really want to do in life and they feel it is the right one.

Some might says it is a good idea for students to commit a career such a young because it will benefit them in life. Here it is were I am go to prove them wrong. Students get stress so easily and they do not need any more of that. Students do not need to feel pressured and it is okay to say that they do not know what that want to be when they grow up. It is not okay to rush students as they enter high school. Students can make their own mind when the thing it is the right time and, also they think they really think what they want to be when they grow up just give them time.

Students can improve their grades in different ways they can do particularly activities like sports, if students do sports they can practice their beneficent for do activities after school. One important thing is that students can receive help from others students or teachers,a lot of students stay after school for receive help especially when they have missing assignments,if they do not understand a topic.

Secondly,students can spend time with their friends, this is important because some students spend their time in technological things like phones,video games and things like that ,others students like to stay after school because they can share time,ideas or comments how they are in their grades,by sharing ideas they can help each other in their work,especially if they do not understand something.

Why, let me tell you; every on has their own unique traits even the traits they get from their parent. lastly animal spirit do show has traits that represent as our character traits. Although,I do disagree with character traits with influences us that help improve our trait that can help us set right path.

Everyone has their own unique traits. Some people has traits like kindness,honesty,caring,and more. Unfourtely that some character traits can't be chose but sometime character traits chose you as your character traits .For example my character traits is pretty weird: kind honesty,helpful,caring,little crazy and lastly trickery like the fox. Same with parents has their own unique character traits;however, parents' character traits can be passed down to children base on their character traits and if they are worthy of the carry their parent's traits. For example,It remind me the time when I am all dressed up and got my hair done after that I look at the mirror; I notice that I look familiar at the time I realized that I look like mom. As poof that I do have my mom's gene meaning I have her physical look. As i explain even character trait and be passed down or chose have own character traits.

Next, everyone has their own spirit animal that is represent your character traits. For example if the person has the character trait which is playful,love water,caring,and fun loving as poof of this person character traits show their spirit animal is dolphin. Therefore, anyone can chose their character trait that is best suit for them. It is unique for people and important having spirit animal and character traits to help them balance it out and chose what character trait that best represent him or her. Which allow the person to identify what spirit animal is and identify which character trait the animal is. For insist,White tiger know for protect their pup like any mother would do as the same trait as our mom has show.

Choosing character trait could be tricky for everyone but it is important to be wise which character trait is best for you. You can choose which character traits,sometime it can lead to having great friend or loving family. But their will be a price to pay like if you are kind then someone will take avenge of you in order to trick or frame you. My opinion is to be strong and persist or sass but your pick add them long with your chosen character trait. Character traits can be blessing in disguise and curse.

As you see chosing your own character trait is better then someone influences you; it only cause problem and change you then your real self. Although, I explain my reason:everyone has there own unique trait ,animal,lastly the price of choosing character trait.

In addition, people already know that leaving the comfort zone is another way to get a personal growing like student that travels to another country to continue his studies or like a doctor how explores new medicine branches to find a cure for illness. Both have the knowledge that exploring areas that they commonly are no related, will help them to grow. Exploring new areas led everyone to get a growing.

To add, People will not be able to grow, if they don't change in order to grow. Persons that know how to do something very well, such as carpenter or construction, they decide to create their own businesses ,but they are scared to fail. They are afraid to do something new as manage a businesses even if they are mastered on it. Entrepreneurs should to undertake their companies, and they should to invest in new equipment try to grow. if they just keep doing the same without invest, they will not grow as company. In contrast, many people say if someone do always the same, they will be a professional in that area. like a professional sport player because they do always the same. However, even the professional sport player do something different every time, they have to improve their skill. If they just keep doing the same they can't play and be the best player either. This ideology is applied to many different areas where the subject want to be successful.

In conclusion, Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement has the reason, for people is not able to achieve their goal when they do constantly the same. People should explore beyond they are used to do in order to get growing. In many circumstances dare to do new things will gave people a benefit. Changes in live are always good it is just will to do it. People don't have to be mastered in one thing but many of them.",4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,1

highly agree with this statment, first impression are a big thing to most peolpe because it shows them how you act around diffrent people. My experiance with first impression are quite because i get nervuos around new people, However people aren't always going to base you of there first impression of you, Even though you can't change people minds on first impressions you can still change on how they look at you later on in life, just on your behavior around them and how you carry yourself around them.

First imression are big key to finding new jobs because it shows the manager how you'll act on the job and it will tell him/her if your worthy enough for the job, sometimes first impreesion are the reason you might even get the job like my brother exprienced with his job he went to the interview with a positive atitude and went in with the mentality of getting the job, I really strognly agree with first impreesions because people really will base you on first impressions.

People first impresison on me are werid and funny, im not even that weird most of the time i dont really care about first imprssions becuase i dont base people of first expressions, i really base them on how they act after you look at them closer.",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.8,1
1979,95FD6DF25420,"Hi my name is Generic_Name and I am going to talk about energy and resources. The reason why we are talking about energy and resourses is because ,some busineses have adopted a four day work week. They want to because they want to conserve energy and resourses.

Each work week is going to be for 10 hours but in my opinon that is not going to work. I think it is not going to work because, people are barely working 8 hour shift and working 10 hour shifts. It is going to be more painful for people, and they are going to get really tired. In my opinion if they are going to make people work for 10 hours for 4 days, they have to increase the minumim wage and pay a little bit more money.

Their is alot of reason why I do not agree with this new change. The only positive reason I see is getting 3 days off. Another positive reason I see for this change is, if you get payed every 2 weeks, and you worked

4 days and, make 40 hours 1 week and 40 hours another week, it is going to be a good paycheck. Now it depends how much you get payed but im pretty sure if you are going to do 10 hours shifts, they are atleast going to pay $12.00 an hour or they are going to pay you $11.00 dollars in hour. Those would be good reasons to work in a job like that. It depends to if the people have time to work 10 hour shifts for 4 days.

Their are some school that want to have those same rules that some jobs have of 10 hours. I do not think that would work for students, because 10 hours of being in school is really stressing. I know how it feel like to be in school for 8 hours, is it is not fun and it is really stress full. I think that the classes in highschool would be more longer the students would not concentrate .The reason they would not concentrate is because, you would be doing a lot of asighnments and, you would lose intrest in what they are teaching and, you would lose focus. In my opinion I would not like that but I am pretty sure the school would like it because, they would be completing more work and they would be finishing lessons really quick and the students would study more.

There would be another advantage to that because the students would be in school for 10 hours for 4 days a week. They would have 3 days off every week that in my opinon it would propably be friday saturday and sunday. It would sound kind of good since you get 3 days off every week, but at the same time no students want to be in school for 10 hours for 4 days a week ,that sounds stressing and hard .You would propably have more classes, a lot of home work ,and more test, and quizes. It would propably be hard for teachers to do 10 hour shift to because ,they would have to do more planings of lessons because they would propably have to teach lot of classes during the day since the school day is 10 hours.

In my opinion this prompt that I wrote today was really intresting. The topic was really intresting it made me think a lot of what I was going to type in this prompt. The topic was really intresting because it was about what I thought about jobs only working 4 days a week and 10 hour shifts. The other part of the topic was what if school was 4 days and 10 hours. This prompt made me put myself in that position and I did not like it if this would ever happen in real life I would be against it .               ",3.0,3.0,2.5,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.7,1

some day of this week my friend bring a pants and i'm saw him, my fist empression was ''naa this not going which you , so i will honest with him , if somebody tell me something that is not pleasing for me i'm sure that i going to put my impression face , and maybe the other person don't like, but it's impossible to change my impression , I will direct which the people ,if the people don`t like my impression i'm sorry for them, yeah maybe it's not correct to say the fist impression , i'm agree for that too, and i understand that some people put angry when i do that , but i can't change my actituded because i'm like this, it's the same with the another people they got them own impression but in different ways , that's fot that i'm agree , and i understand that is so important to me beacuse i don't know if the other person feel bad when i say the first impression , that's why i need to improve my impression , some people and my friends are annoying with me for this , and that's why i need to practice respect to myself and the another people.

The fist impression is bad idea because if i'm in the job and my boss tell me that my work is not like this, and i say my fist impression that's sure that my boss will put annying because maybe he try to teach me, and the fist thing that i do is my impression and is not a good imprression,

some impression are good because when somegirl look beautiful my impression going to be wow i like how they look today , so impression can be good or bad,

the impression can used in different ways, can use in possitive and negative forms so we decide what kind of impression to used , but a lot a time we only used a negative impression in that is not correct , for example if i or some friend bring something or do something we need to do an possitive impression but we always give a negative impression and that is not correct we need to encourage this person but we only do negative things.

Having a godd impression we are more than we can imagene because everybady respect to you and nobody got problem with you , and thats a opportunities to alot of ways in your life .

Students could be benefited if they attend classes by coming to school so that they can be attentive in class and will be able to clear their doubts.

Students will not be benefited if they attend classes from home by online or video conferencing because then they will not concentrate much on studies and which will lead to bad grades. They will not be having test and quizzes often. They might become lazy and start copying each other work. If they do not attend school, then there will be less chances of students doing work sincerely at home. They will not be able to get proper education at home and there will be less communication with students and teachers. If there will be less communication then they will not be able to get more open with others. There will be no group work so that students can share their ideas regarding studies. They might start taking breaks often. There will be no routine for students for studying at home. They will not be able to concentrate much working at home due to lot of distractions like T.V, movies, videos games, text ting etc. If you will not get a better education you might not be able to sussed in life. The more you have the education then there are more chances of getting a bright future. The proper education you can get is by going to school. If you will attend school, then you can correct your mistakes and learn from them. If you will stay at home you won't know what are you doing correct and what you are doing wrong.

How much you learn and read more the better because learning and reading takes you around the world. Teachers should also watch every student more carefully because if a student is doing something wrong then teachers can help them and make sure they go in the correct way. Parents should also keep an eye on their student that how they are doing because if they are not then parents can also guide them.

2538,BC8115EEB029,"Being a teenager is hard in are decae. Because as a teenager growing up in this period of time is hard. If you do not follow the trend, do what others does. People will judge you and,also you might not be cool enough to have friends. But at the end of the day you have yourself respect. I agree that you should be yourself. Because you should be proud of who you are ,and will be succes, happy, and do what you good at.

Some people say, Individally we are one in order to be one only you got be proud of who you are ,nor letting anyone change you. For instance, first when I moved in here in 2016 from Egypt. I was a 14 years old. It could have affected me. When people were making fun of my English. because I did not know how to speak It ,and did not know the culture. Which It was hard for me. But I was proud of me self for trying to learn ,and still I'm learning everyday something new. It's a good feeling to feel proud of yourself. Even when people try to hate on you or make fun of you're accent. If you are a strong person nothing will stop you. From being proud ,and making you're family proud because they work hard for to be succesful in the future.

Succes is not easy. There is a lot of reason's for those who are succful. They worked hard for It. Mian reason how they became succesful is never give up. That is the key not giving up, being yourself. While people in my school having ''fun''. I stay home studying to become succesful ,and make myself proud. Also my family. Teenager should not be a follwer. Everyone should be them self. For example,There is always the good ,and bad. You choice who you hangout with. Will help you with what you wanna be in the future. If you hang with people that do sports and healty that is good because you will be succesful.

Once you do what you always had planing for in the future. You will feel happy. And to be in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else. That will even make you happier. To be more specific. Trying to be you're self while everybody is differnt is not easy. Sometimes students affor me to smoke in the bathroom. I always say no. They might laughe at me for not smoking ,and not being ''cool'' . However, I think of who I'm if I do not like doing something. I should not do it because someone else is doing it or to make other happy but not myself.

Some might say, I disagree you should not be you're self. Because other people can not be them self or might harm them self in a way. such as doing drugs,skiping school, not being respectful to you're family ,and friends. However, I think being yourself in a world that is trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. cause it makes you. proud of who you are,succesful in what you do Aslo, It makes you happy for what you have accomplish.

so Generic_Name i would not recommend not changing the school menu because. the student would not be very happy at school and if the school menu changes. mostly the student would will bring their own lunch from home and bring it in to the cafeteria and the school lunch food would be wasting . because the students wouldnt eat the school lunch food because majorly the student are bring their own lunch. which its not a very bad idea because students can bring their own lunch and they will not be starving to death with out skipping lunch and going going home with their stomach full instead of empty which it is a good thing. so i think not changing the school menu is a very good idea because friend and i can have free choices of what i like to eat and what the whole school would like to eat or bring the Owen lunch to school which i think it a very good idea because if i had the freedom to to bring my own lunch or choice in the cafeteria. i would eat very well and i wont have an empty stomach the whole entered day in school. and i will not be sleepy for the rest of the day and the few class i have at the end of the day.

i think sum of the students will do the same thing as me if we all eat very good and very well in school in the cafeteria and it will be nice.

Mrs. Generic_Name i think that most student would not like to have a healthier school lunch menu becuase no student usaly get school lunch in school so the students usaly bring in their own school lunch and which its a very good go idea because the student can bring what they like to eat during lunch time .and if you change the school lunch menu then the student wouldnt get school lunch any more. and if the whole school didnt jget the school lunch any more because they dont like the new school lunch menu. it because no one like to eat very healthy at school and maybe if the whole school didnt get lunch and every single student in Generic_School pack their own lunch with its a bad sin becuse all the food would be wasting . so mrs Generic_Name pelase dont change the school lunch menu becuase most student wouldnt be happy if the school lunch menu changes and every every student in Generic_School would be so happy and glad if you didnt change the school lunch mean.

3775,FA3D872358BF,Although some people don't like using technology it's a good thing because thanks to technology we can now talk with family members who live far away and also you can meet lots of new friends on the internet. But i get some people are afraid to talk to new people because they don't know about the person their meeting with but once they meet the person they talk about what the person life is like. But technology is taking over the world because for example stores are getting shut down because you can now buy anything on the internet there's no point of having stores everyone now uses amazon or eBay to stuff that you would find in Walmart. And a lot of stores are already out of business like Kmart because stuff you would find at Kmart are on amazon or eBay. Cars can be bought online you don't need to go to the dealer ship you now just get your computer and look for the you want and they can deliver the car right to your house .Also we have Tesla which are cars that are electric and you charge them instead of putting gas in them and also they this feature called Autopilot which means the cars drives by it's self and all you have to do is pull that switch on and then just have your hands on the steering wheel for safety reasons but they are trying to make it where you only have pull the switch and just look out the window also they are very fast it can beat a Lamborghini and when you brake you are charging the battery .But also people are losing their jobs because of this but they can also work using technology instead of working at a store they work at a Amazon factory plus they pay very well .So what do I think of technology I think it's awesome because it gives you new opportunity's that we use to not have when technology did not exist. And it's changing not only the world but also the universe because we have technology everywhere like in the moon we sent a Tesla Roadster and we also have satellites in the sky that tell us what happening in the sky.,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.6,1
1741,83C48C5697AE,"Living in a place with frequentely hihgest demand to provide my best, is one the must important achievement. I agree with Emerson statement because with the individuality we can reach all our goals.

It is to important for me to recognize that i have to get my goals with effort. Because this help to provide, work hard, competition, and bocome the best .Individuality is a good factor to trust in my self to be the best because help us to look for option that help our lifes

.Working by my self make me work hard. when a person work by his own company he try to do a great work fixing everything it is the such as work alone, if you work alone yo going to do a perfect job to impresione others labors .For example, when i work without partner, i try to do a great gob to be one on the best workers. When i do my own work i feel excite cause, i could receive an award for be a good producer. everybody want to be award for their job so everrybody wish a reward. But to be award we have to hsave capacity in the jobs Many person due the same thing like me cause doing my the own work provide a big result. So working by my self make an emotion to work hard and to increase the amoung. Consequently to do a individual work make a good results. Doing own projects workers show more production In the factory and result good Therefore this help to get alot resources by workers.

Competiton is a ways to decrease the teamwork. individual competition is a big example of overcome. Examples could be when a person start to work in his job and start to recieve more money because the person is doing a great work ,this make that others poerson get mad so in the factory start the competition cause everyone want to recieve more money and they thick is unfair be reciving the same amoung of money so they start to argued why the manager give more money to the new guy but the thing is that he has a good specialization in the job. concecuently Many time the work competition provide a good production in the factory so, everyone want to get their goals like a good amount of products also,big accomplishment occur with the worker is trying to find a new way to get more product than other. For example, when a worker finished his assignment could receive free time,this make feel angry other workers so , they are going to try to look for others forms to produce more than the winner because, they want to receive the same reward for the production . To do a good competition the work have to be alone to and with big group people. competition is a good way for individuality work to provide a emotional affect. In many companies the owners look for a way that workers produces a lot and they offer money or free time to the person that make more products .as result, being in a factory with many labors working seperated make a big impact where everyone want to procud the most materials. Therefore,challenge could be a a good idea for separated jobs .

Looking for an accomplishment to become the best. Every one in this life want to have something to be recognize in this world althogh,to be a succefull person we have to work hard. Not matters what tell about us such as critique,bullying ,etc. The only thing that is important for us who we are. So the best thing that could can happens in our life is be a place where frecuently we are demand to do different things. Although with many problem we have to be patience and support all bad things. Because,if we wish to be different than the rest of persons and realize our goals. thought must be working by our selves. Because sometimes nobody is with us to provide help. fighting by my self i could be a big man in the socierity. Currently in the world we have many competition one example can be soccer,almost the majority look in the tv .Soccer is a game where a team have 24 for player. They have to compite who is the leader in the team. So like in the real life the leader is the person that work hard,help the other players .Otherwise, could be a leader in a company, to be the leader of a company ,the leader had to compite with other person that wanted to become a big leader ..Therefore to be a person succesfull have to take individual decision .

Being in a world where have to take decision and concern about goals is the best thing that we can have to show our capacity. Doing my own job make me put effort and dedication. Work in gruop is affect by bet. Being a different person than others. The person that different quality could be someone that can help. Because, this kind of person make the differences in the world trying to win in a place where the competition and the demand are in high level ,so they try to have imfluences in the in their jobs. The individuaity help alot in the world to be a succesful place. For example in the govermen there are many people with a big level to compite with other this, that means it i s has a great achievement in the government,so i agree with Emerson statement cause the competition provide good benifit for us and too the progress of the government,factory,countries,therefore being a part with competiton meke us to improve our best",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.8,1
1768,85E3C840FCBF,"I agree with the idea of a year-round school because It sounds great to me. This idea has a lot of benefits towards the students and also the educators too. This idea provides a beneficial environment for both the students and the educators.

One of the reasons that this is a great idea is that,It makes the students to retain information easily when they get back from their break. They would retain information easily because the break they were given wasn't a long break and that will help them remember the materials that they were taught before the break. The other reason is that,the students will gain more knowledge by learning more materials. They will learn a lot of which will be beneficial to them,not only inside the school but also outside the school. They will also stay on task and be more focused on their studies.

Another reason is that,this idea of a year-round school will make work easy for the educators. It will make their work easy by not making them repeat the materials that the previously have taught because the students are able to remember the materials easily. They won't be forced to create retake tests and assignments and that would allow them to have an easy job. An example of why a year-round school is beneficial is that,It creates an environment where the students enjoy learning and the educators enjoy teaching.

Lastly,I would say that a year-round school is a great idea because It creates an environment where both the students and the educators can benefit from. It Impacts both the students and the educators in a productive way. The students would have more passion and love towards learning while the educators would also gain more passion towards their profession and remarkably enjoy teaching.",2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5,3.0,2.8,1

Where is one place in the world you would like to visit this place,and what you would want to do or see once you arrive there.

First,One place i would want to visit is Spain because there are beautiful places like for example Generic_City,Spain orGeneric_City,Spain. Those are the two places that majority of the people wants to visit those places. Majority of the people want to visit Generic_City,Spain orGeneric_City,Spain because of the soccer teams that are there.

2586,BFCE7D755436,"Do you think should student to use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes ?

A lot of young people has cell phones that can use for many ways. The young people use their cell phones for text with their family or do their homework, but Today's many kids are going away from people. However, they use the cell phone in bad ways in classroom, so, I believe students should not use the cell phones in class because they could cheat in their exams and get easy score.

The first reason , when the teacher says, ""get out the phone, we are going to start study in our phone"". The students does not care when the teacher is giving the instructions of the topic. A lot of students are going to playing games or listening music and when the teacher ask question about of the topic they would say, ""i do not know' and every body starts to laugh because they were not paying attention in the classroom and their grades is going down.

The second reason,Today's in the world student only put their face in the cell phones. A lot of student use the cell phone for their social media in classes, therefore, Student are not paying attention in class when the teacher is explaining the topic. However, student when the cell phone is allowed to use, they will have more focus in their social media than classes. For example, A lot of student have the famous ""snapchat"" that it is film videos for ten seconds and share in your story for people see them, Student with their cell phones are going to put any video in their story to showing the teacher talking or everybody laughing.

Another reason and is the most important, Student cheat in exams with their cell phones because the teacher says, ""you can use your cell phones in this test"". however, students do not study for any home work or test. they can get a easy score. For example, they know can use the cell phones in test, but this time the teacher says, ""you cannot use the cell phones in this test."" The student are going to get bad scores because they thought that can use the cell phone to get a great score. however, a lot student do not study for any test when they can use the cell phone.

However, The propose of the teacher is that student earn easy information and good scores. The allowed to use the phone has a good way that students can search homework or read a book. Sometimes the teacher gives homework to do at home and you will use your cell phone for solve the homework. For example, students are learning other language and do not know some word in the information gave the teacher, they can use the translate to know the word.

In conclusion, Students should not allowed to use the cell phones in classrom because they are not going to learn anything at the final of year. Allowed to use the cell phone is a disadvantage for students in the futures in their jobs because they were always in their cell phone playing or social media.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.1,1

3605,F3604BAC5D79,"I agree with the Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill because in my opinion, the failure makes to the people strong and the next time they can do it better. Sometimes we are making failures day per day, but if we become sad and we are closed that we can not do it again, we are losing something important in our life, but if we are doing it with enthusiasm we can improve our failures and do it better every time. Success is the achievement of doing what you have tried to do or what to do. Winston Churchill is referring that no one have to loss the enthusiasm, however if you are making mistakes in your life and you are saying that you can not do it and you will try it but you are going to get the same results and you are giving excuse by excuse you will fail in your life because you are giving up easily and you dont see that every cost and fight at the end it has a benefit or something that you really wanted to get or a goal that you are trying to reach and you will see that you dont have to loss the hope and the enthusiasm in every dream that you want.

The failure has an important role in the pursuit of success, sometimes a lot of people do not have the enthusiasm and they think that it is the end of everything, the failure can be the destruction for a lot of people, but if you make a lot of mistakes and you are keeping fighting still to get your goals you will see how important is not give up easy and watch the positive part of your failures. When Winston Churchill said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm,"" he is only saying that sentence but it has a big meaning everybody can apply it in their lives, you can find the best outcomes just smiling to the problems. It does not mean that you will not care the problems, of course you have to resolve the problems and make them clear, because if you are making failures and people is affected and you dont care you just want to get your outcomes it will be a big problem, no body needs to be involved in your failures because the people around you will see that you are making a mistake and you are selfish.

Churchill's statement has big meanings and has good outcomes, everybody wants success but what happen when someone is trying to get success and miss? of course everyone will feel so sad and no one wants to try it again because the person is afraid of their failures, it is like if the failure is tying you and it does not want to leave you. The persons will be sad and their hopes will be down because they think that they are going the get the same outcome, but what happen if you raise your head with enthusiasm? Winston is trying to say us that the enthusiasm is very important to get the success because if you have enthusiasm you will fight with love for something that you really want. An enthusiasm person has more possibilities to get success than a person sad, broken and a person who is thinking just negative thoughts or who is close that they will get the same result and give up easily like nothing will happen if he/she is going to try it.

The enthusiasm has an important role in the success because you will keep your head up and keep fighting for your goals all the time and every time that you will make a failure it will be more easy to resolve it, because you have a key and you are enrolling every time when you get one failure. The enthusiasm help to the people to see the answer of the problems easily because the brain will be relaxed and will think the best things, however, when the brain is frustrated the brain can not think correctly. So, if you are enthusiasm you will do it very good because you want something that you want and also it will be something that will improve your life not just in the success of work or study it can be in all your whole life you can get success and everything if you apply this in your life, and the people around you like your family will see how important is this role in the life and they will want to learn about the enthusiasm in the failures and they will understand that sometimes we dont need to destroy ourselves or lost the head in something that we can resolve in an easy way that enthusiasm is helping us to improve ourselves.

I agree with Churchill's statement because the enthusiasm it is an important role you can motive to other people to be enthusiasm and they can resolve their problems using the same method. Sometimes the failure are really hard to resolve but if you really want to reach it you have to feel enthusiasm because I think that automatically you will see the answer clearly and easily and if you are frustrated your brain will not work and will be closed and sometimes when we are frustrated we are getting extras failure because we dont think clearly and we dont think about it. Sometimes we have to learn a lot from the failure and we dont see it, the failure can be some steps just to reach the success and the goods outcomes. Winston is showing us that the failure can be defeated it does not matter how long it is going to take but before the success you have to keep strong and smiling to the big failure. Winston Churchill is using a statement that means that we dont have to give up easily we have to fight for something that we want to make real.

Example: The success in the school can be really difficult and more than one time we can fail because we dont do homework but we want to pass, so if we want to reach this goal we have to enthusiasm ourselves because we have a goal that we want to reach, so we are going to fix our failure and we are going to do everything because after school we want to go to college and get a good job.

In conclusion, the Churchill's statement has an important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. The failure is just a difficult step to reach the success and with enthusiasm we can defeat to the failures. The enthusiasm is a supply very important in the enroll for the success.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.2,1
2767,CAC6822F740C,"Cell phone should be allow in classroom

Cell phone are very useful in our daily life, we use them at home to see our social media and to be in contact with our family and friends that are far away from us, to buy thing, at work for any emergency and to make our shop list, but in a classroom maybe not much. Although, Some people believe that the cell phones shouldn't be allow in classroom. Actually, I think that cell phone should be allow in classroom because it allow students to find information fast about what they need and they can write note on their cellphone that they can read at any time they want.

Some people that believe that cellphones shouldn't be allow in classroom have their reasons. They think that students that use their cell phone in classroom don't pay attention at what the teacher is teaching them and that could be something that might help them in the future and they think that it is really disrespectful for the teacher that the students use their cell phone during class while he is talking. Also they think that student might use their cell phone to cheat during a test.

Cellphone allow students to find any information fast about what they need for the class or group project. A school computer sometimes takes a several moment to log in. Waiting for the computer to log is really stressful because we might not have much in class and many students work after schools so they might not have time to finish it at home. Also help students that are new in this country and that do not know English. They can translate any word they don't know in English. This way students learn more English and faster.

The students can use their cell phone to write notes on their cell phone that they can read at any time they want because students are often using their cell phone. students might in their work, in their friend's house, walking home or any where else and they just need to take out their cell phone. Also students they can study for a test anywhere they go at any time they want to because they always have their cell phone with them.

In conclusion, the students should be allow to use their cellphone in classroom because it allow students to find information fast about what they need and they instead of using a computer or dictionary can write note on their cellphone that they can read at any time they want and wherever they go.

577,2BE11993FB5F,"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. I personally disagree with this statement because, many times i have been told that i have a bad first impression the first time people see me, many people say i look mean and with a bad attitude. However, i do not have an attitude when people are friendly or speak me.

New research says that it is far easier to loose a good reputation, then to gain one. Which is true, but you would never know how is the other person until you speak to them. You cannot judge a person by the way they look, speak or drees. For example, couple of years back on my first day of school, in the United States, people would judge me because, they thought i knew English, and when they would speak to me, i would put my head down and not say anything, months later i learned english and knew how to have a conversation with them; Not long a long, i had a person come to me and say; I did not thnk you spoke english, because i remember back in 6th grade, you would not talk. He changed the way he thought of me when i started having a conversatiomn with him. Perphas, You can always change you first impression.

First impressions are clearly not the best ones, but we can always make a choice on wheather change them or not. I have experienced many first impressions. However, i have always told myself that my reputation does not depends on how others see or think of me, depends on how i see myself.

3348,E7A9FD471BE3,"Graduating earlly should be a good idea because students are abkt to accomplish it early, students may have goals in life they want to achive and they might have other responsibilities to take care off. Some poeple said that graduating early is a good idea becasue students can relive some stress but some student say that is not a good idea because students may miss the best year of thier life. So thinking about it, should you graduate early or not.

First of graduating early is a goog idea because of the responsiblity a student have outside of school. Students may have work or some issue that are not school base things. For example my friend had a kid. She graduated early last year, now shes able to go to college or go to work force while taking care of her kid. Some student may have sport team outside the school that may help them to be professional player. For example soccer players can go professional without going to college. Beach Fc or anyone soccer club out there may help those players become a pro.

Seconly. Students may want to acoomplush it early as possible. Students may want to graduate early becasue thet want a time off school before going to college. Students may be sick of going to school because of how many lesure are there everyday. For example my friend graduate early last year because he wanted to get it done early. He wanted to step back for a bit before going to college. Going to school is stressfull enough for students, Exams, Sol, Text, ect. Students use this meated to have a years off school before going to college or going stright to work force,

Thirdly. Students may have goals in their life that they wanted to accomplish early after school. Students may have a sport team that are able to help they turn into a pro. or a gaming team to turn them a pro. students have a lot of goals in there life also. Graduating early may help them to get a head start so they wont be falling behind with people. I read a story once that a guy that graduted early. He became a proffetional soccer player on are 17 or 18. He is a incredible player, One of the best in the world.

If a student could graduate early; the students can accomplish things that they couldn't after highschool. if a student can graduate, they can focus on other responsinilities outside of school. If I can graduate early, I can accomplish my goals early than others. Graduating early can be a good idea. for example student may graduate early becuase of they're responsibilities outside of school, students may have goals in life that they want to accomplish first or a student just wanted a time off school. You have a chose. take it or leave it.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.3,1
3173,DF193A9E1C5A,"Thomas Jefferson wrote Determine never to be idle.. it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing. I agree that we accomplish more if we are always doing something right or important, however, that it doesnt mean that you are idle. While, if we are working or study.

They are many people that works on importants jobs, sometime they suggest you to have a lot of energy and be preparated. For example at the job alot of employees that against you because they said that you are idle, and you dont want to do nothing. Insted that the employees at your job dont know that you are tired because you have two jobs.

Some people, students or parents lived so tire and they look idle. At my house we live all togethers and sometime i dont to do nothing at my house. My parents argument me that i dont clean the house. For example that i dont study or help my mom with my little brother. In addition my family doesnt know that i have tow jobs because i want to help her to play the rent of the house, that why some people lookd idle or tired.

They are some friends that they teach you and they support you to be a better person with good behaviour those people want you to be how great you are doing something productive. Neverles, some friends want you to be like them with bad reputation. For example unemplayment, without money, you need to be reponsibility of your acts.

In conclusion, it doesnt matter if other people are telling you idle or unemplayment, they are time that it is hard to find a job or you just want to rest because you are tire, it is wonderful to know that how much may be done if are always doing something;Therefore, some people think that does inactivity also serve a purpose. In my opinion they should be doing somthing at life to receive a good pupose in your life.                            ",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.5,2.7,1
2325,ACEDBB3C81A0,"They say some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by a way of online or video conferencing. I agree that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because some students rather attend to a class at home than at the school so they can focus more; However, some students suffer from bullying, and they rather stay at home and study than attend to school and get bullied again and again. Attend to school at home is a different type of learning is at your own place you got peace.

Attend to school at home is different when you talk about focus, at home, you at your own place quiet, you don't have people around you to stop you or distract you. One day at high school I was trying to focus for a test retake but I coudn't because my friend kept distracting me and that made fail my retake. If I was at home learning in peace without distractions maybe I would pass the test. The point is that studying at home is quiet and calm what can help you successfully at your school grades.

One of the biggest reasons students attend to classes at home is due to bulllying every high school students suffer from bullying whats is wrong but we can't change people we got sometimes you got to change your strategy so you can live a healthy life, thats why some students decide instead of getting bullied every day attend to school at home. I had a problem at freshman year that i've got bullied every time because of how skinny I was and I was kind sad, all my grades went down and I didn't knew what to do;Therefore, if I decided to attend school at home I woudn't have to face this problem every school day. In this case being abble to attend school at home helps a lot of students.

Allthrough, attend school at home got some issues too, when you attend school at home you don't socialize, you don't get to know a lot people, One of my favorite soccer player once said that ""the only thing that attending school at home does not help is at socializing, meeting new people."" that's of the reason not a lot people attend school at home, because they like to meet new friends, being together with people that you like.

Therefore, students benefit from being able to attend classes at home, you can focus more and you is a option that you can take if you have any obstacle in your way at school such as bullying or something like that, nowadays is more common to see people taking online classes. All the schools should have online classes that you can take at home so every student can study the way they want to study;Therefore, students benefit by being able to attend classes at home.",3.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.5,3.0,1
1769,85F4C57672EA,"""Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home""? I do not believe that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. I believe the students can get distracted so easily at home. For example, you start watching a movie; when you were supposed to your homework. That would affect your grade because you didn't do it on time. Another, example is when your mom tell you to buy something and then you forgot what were you doing. In addition, time is another reason why is not beneficial taking classes from home.

Time is one of the consequences attend to classes online is not beneficial because unexpected things can happen. You can't control time. For example, someone in your family die or they have a car crash or even work schedule. Those examples can affect you by reducing the time and material you were to work on. That's why you can't predict what is unexpected. Unexpected times take away your energy, concentration and comprehension on what your studying. Another, reason why classes from home isn't good.

Energy keep you awake. Being concentrate shows interest on what you doing and comprehension is how much you understand. If you're sleepy you cannot do any of that. However, I want to focus more in the comprehension part. Never ever compare a teacher vs a computer. For example, you didn't understand the new unit because is confusing, you can always put your hand up and ask the teacher. The teacher will explain at their best for you to comprehend. On the contrary, you can't do it because you're at home and nobody can explain the material you don't understand.

Some students agree they can benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they can do it later, if they miss something on class. Also, they can study anywhere they can have access to it. That reject to be in certain place. You're free to study and work without any restrain. All you need is to manage your time.

You be able to kill two birds on the same shot.

To conclude, students will realize that a teacher is way better than a computer. The teachers study the materials on what they gonna teach and they graduate from college, gain a diploma of what they teaching you. They have the proof and I believe they are doing the right choices about giving you materials for you on the future. That's why i would never change them for one computer at home.

907,45A86623B659,"Do you agree or disagree about the importance of attitude? I agree with the importance of attitude, because with your atitude you can motivate yourself to do the best in your life, and you can motivate other people to do the best in their life. Some people think that in this life your positive attitude is the key to do good in everything, because if you go to any place, job, or to the school with positive attitude your life its going to be excellent.

In this life the success is the key, because if people have negative attitude in everywhere, they just don't want to nothig. For example, if they go to the school/collage with negative attitude, maybe they don't want to learn new things about the class, because they are going to be mad, and they don't want to do work with negative attitude, but if the people go with positive attitude they can learn averything they want, or learn more than they know about the class, because be positive means that you want be success in your life, also means that people want to do the best in everything.

Second, people can do better in this life with positive attitude, because they want be graduated from collage wih positive attitude, and with them positive attituted they maybe motive to other people to do the same thing, with their positive attitude they learn more, they are going to do work, homework, and classwork, because in this life the key is the attituded, that means everything you do, do with positive attitute,if you do that you are going to learn new things easy.

Some people argue that in this life you don't need positive attitude, because they only think if you pay attention, do homework, and finish classwork in the school/ collage so you can be success in this life, they only think about to be responsible with their works, not about to have positive attitude. People also argue that in the works you don't need positive attitude, because the only thing you need is experience, work, and be resposible.

In conclusion, if you do everything with positive attitude we can learn things more easy, and you are going to be success in this life, because you motivate yourself to do the best, also you can motivate people to do the same thing, to be success in this life, with positive attituded you can do everything, because you want to learn new things in this life.",3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.5,2.7,1

Taking myself as an example or personal experienced person,I had always wanted to be a model when I was kid which I still want to be, but one thing have noticed is that you can't do anything on your own without sometimes you need help from people around you. Becoming a model was my idea and something I think it will be better for me and nothing beyond that standard; was calling people for help, applying from one agency to the other but there was no help. Sometimes people even want to take advantage of that to use for their satisfaction(sexually) even though I know that is bad I still wanted to do it because of the goals I have set for myself .

Am now living with my mom and step dad so they the ones providing for me; I don't work,I can't buy personal stuff and that makes me feel bad ,it makes me feel like am not doing anything in this world. Sitting idle will never let me grow until I do something better for myself.

Maybe they leave lonely, far aways from they family, or they have to help theire parent pay the rent, or other stuff to pay in they own too.

First of all I think it's would be a great benefit is, at same same time you can do other activity, and you can took it whenever you want, before or after work it all depend on what you think will be better for you.

Secondly if you have some family problem or you have to go somewhere immediately for a long time. That is an opportunity for you to learn or to not loss all the days you have been absent at the school.

An other opportunity is if you go to college and you have a job at same time, if your classes are in the morning fron 8 AM to 4 PM, and you job schedule is at 1 PM to 11 pm .

Although, during the summer break some students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall, overall, the summer is a good season to have a school break because of the great weather and the posibilities to get a job for students.

Initially, we all know summer is the best season of the year, because it brings more attractions. Of course, the weather is one of the important factors that makes it possible. For example, amusement parks to entertain people, beaches's opening, as well as others entertainment places to go visit and have fun. Summer also is a known as a time where family can share moments with others and recover all the energies leaving the stress at home. Also many people likes the summer, beacuse you can practice any sport you want outside, a good way to decrease the percent of obesity and improve our helth. Another advantage of the summer is that we have more sun light during this season than winter, spring or fall, it allowing us to get done more stuff we need to do and being productive with our time. In short, the students's vacations should be in summer, because is a great season to do many activities and enjoy with friends and family.

In addition, as we have more attractions, more personal the companies need, which gives to many people the opportunity to get a job. As a students, a job is helpful in several aspects for good on their lives. For example, maturity, responsability , new experiences and connections-which is very important to your future. Each one prepares you as a person to deal with your every day lives. Also, students have enough time to save their money and keep it for their purposes, it can be for a college or buy whatever they want without the necessity to pay with their parents's money. As a result, students are aviable to gain their own money during the summer, because its offer more opportunities, and also gain new experiences that will help them move fordward.

Still, some may say that summer vacations are too long and there should be year-round schools, which would totaly change how long the breaks will be. Then, students can have a balence on their personal lives and scholar lives. The knoledge they aquired is still fresh in their minds so, new stuff to learn will be easier for them and consequently they will obtain good grades. In summary, the significance of the idea to administrate better how long, and the appropiate time for a break is to know if it are gonna affect the student progress, which is the priority of the school.

In conclusion, educators wants the best for students,and they just want to find out a better way to rise their progress making them as a better students improving their knoledges. But, it can becomes as an issue because if you are constantly over preassure, and studying all the time without an a consider time to free your mind, it will get you tired. Overall, the summer vacations will keep you distracted with many productive activities during a long break, which are gonna let you back to school more exited and willing to keep study.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.4,1

This decision should solve with their families, because this decision shouldn't made by school, school should help not control students to do the extracurricular for their good experiment with other student or get involved with different team works, and some student don't want to do or stay after school program or any other extracurricular activities.

First, whether student wants to join or do extracurricular activities they should ask parents or families first, because some parents don't wants to do the extracurricular activities. Example, some students have a lot of homework, project, tests or their different school works. Some parents don't want let the kids or students to do the extracurricular activities because of their other school works. This can cause their student fail the school or other stuff can happened to them. This is why extracurricular activities decision should made by families not by schools.

Then, school should help not control students to do the extracurricular for their good experiment with other students or get involved with team works. Some school wants students to do join clubs, sports, and any other after school program, because some after school program needs students to do join their program by forcefully. Example some sports coach ask to do join their team but the student don't want to join for some kind of reason, and sometime they email or call to their parents to let them join our programs. Some student don't want to join any after school program for some reason. This is why after school program or extracurricular activities should made by families decision.

Lastly, some student don't want to stay after school program or any other activities. Some student are already tired from school example, some students is already taking lot of extra classes at school and they probably have lot of test and quiz or even homework. If they decided to do after school program or any other extracurricular activities then it's up to their families choice, but most of students don't want to stay after school because they already have lots of homework, projects, prepare for their quiz and tests. If school wants to control student to get involve with any other after school activities then it can cause students grades, lack of sleep, and other stuff can happen to students. This is why extracurricular activities decision should made by their families or by parents.

This is why I want parents or families to make a decision about after school programs. This is the three reason that I want families make a decision about after school programs not by school. Although many people believe that school should control student involvement in extracurricular activities. For me I disagree that school should not make a decision for students, decision should made by students families or by their parents for my three reasons. ",3.5,2.5,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.5,3.2,1
1441,6E842F21D6E4,"There are people in every part of the world that, they can not be retract based on what they say, or on what they have done as a result of their acts giving in their first impressions. The first impressions can give to a people in a idea, feeling, or an opinion. A people can hurt someone else feeling based on their opinion, because they do not think what adequate words they going to say. And when they want to fix the problem may be too late. The first impressions are almost impossible to change, because people can hurt someone else feelings and cause people change.

First impressions can hurt people's feelings in fact, I did to my sister yesterday. My sister and I were talking about her wedding yesterday, her wedding is next year in April, and we are preparing for her best day ever. We have to look for her dress and all the things that she is going to use for that day. She is like my second mother, and I want to make sure she looks beautiful on that day. While we were talking and looking for dresses in the internet, she saw a wedding dress, and my first impression was like, no that dress is ugly, and I told her she was going to look like a real skull in dress, because she is skinny. But I never thought I was going to hurt her feelings in my first impression, the dress was ugly, even though she liked but I wanted for her the pretties dress for her wedding. I felt badly for her, because I did not think my words before I said to her. I told her sorry, but she was little upset about me for the words I said to her, as I always say, what people say is what they receive. Lately my sister did not talk to me, I was sad and I talk to her, I apologized for the words I said. She told me it was okay, that I did not meant to said it. My sister and I, we are happy now. In the following manner, my friend Generic_Name invited me on her birthday and Her friend told me that I was looking ugly, and that I was a ugly and slow girl, in front of her other friends, her impressions about me hurt my feelings. She retract based on what she said, but it was too late, I left from Generic_Name party I went home, and I was little sad, the girl went to my home she wanted to talk to me, she apologized and I told her she hurt my feeling but I was fine, and gave her some advises and she left with this, first impressions are almost impossible to change because hurt someone else feelings.

Additionally, first impressions can cause people change, as an example of my best friend I gave her an opinion about her boyfriend. I told her that he does not love her, because I saw him kissing with a girl in the school. She told me I was crazy, I was just jealous because she had the most handsome boyfriend in the whole world. Matter of fact he was cute, but he wanted just play with the girls. My best friend change with me a lot, she did not want to talk to me no more. About the things that I told her. Lately I realized that he had a twin brother I made a mistake, that my first impressions to him was a fatal mistake. After all, I wanted to apologize with my best friend, but she was mad with me. It was impossible to talk with her. I realize that my first impressions about the idea of his boyfriend had change my friendship with her. Today I just talk rarely with her, it was almost impossible to change my idea, but I did, but my friendship is changed. First impressions cause people change.

Some people may say, the first impressions is possible to change immediately, because is not a big deal. They may say that the other people, does not care about their first impressions from them. But this is not case, people always get hurt when they receive a bad impressions to them, they make them to change even with themselves. First impressions are almost impossible to change, even if the problem is big.

Thus, the first impressions is almost impossible to change, because what people say is not easy to retract. Is not easy to correct the mistakes, is not easy to correct the words that people do not meant say them. If people say their impressions without thinking them, and then apologized that is fine, but sometime is almost impossible to correct the first impressions, because people hurt someone else feeling. Also, there are sensitive people and they may not forgive people. People may change based on someone else idea, feeling, and opinion. The impressions are almost impossible to change.                          ",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.2,1
142,0AFAD06336F3,"Attending classes from home is not a good idea. I think it's better to attend classes at school for many reasons that I have experienced at home. It's not fun becuase you don't have any teacher to explain to you what you don't understand (well you will have a teacher but he or she wont be there personally), you won't get any help from no one if your taking the online course. Also student will not benefit it because they will be off track and instead of doing there work or what they are suppose to be doing, they will be wondering around by the internet. I defenitly do not agree that the student will benefit attending classes at home.

Having a tecaher with you in class is wonderful. There will be a point when you will have so many questions about the topic that you were discussing with the class. When your in class at school you will learn so much from teachers by giving out examples that are being giving out to the class and explaining it to you. But if your taking an online course It's defenitly more difficult for you to understand the main idea of the lesson. We won't have a teacher right next to us. We have to work indepentdently with out a friends help. It's not similar to when your in class and you ask a friend for help, they will love to help you out. Online class you won't have a friend helping you out. We have to take so many notes in order to understand the objective of the lesson. I personally had so much trouble with the online class, I had to take about 3-5 lessons each day, I had to write down notes for each lesson, I had to take at least five quizzes each day. I had to re-read the lesson like threes time in order to understand and capture the important facts. Honestly you learn how to be more organize and independent each day. I personally consider students to attend classes at school. It's not a good idea doing online class and taking so many notes.

In class, tecahers are strict when student have there electonic out whil there tecaheing or when student are working on class work. At home and doing your class work and at the same time being on your phone, your not paying fully interest on your class, Since you home, don't have a teacher, you feel like you have the right to be on your phone and laptop and do what ever you want, and not doing you work. That shouldn't be the case if you stay home and take the online class, It's because to there was a purpose. If we don't pay attention to what we are doing, and we are paying more attention to our phones we will never learn anything abiut the course. That could cause use to fail the class. Than, we got to re-teake the class.

In my opinion I will also agree to some student that wants to take the online class because you can wake up late, taking you time to eat breakfast. It's not like going to school having to get up so early, not having the time to eat, and having to chase the school bus. I'm that type of person that loves to sleep. But it's our responsibilty to do our work and tun it on time before the deadline. If you dont want to fail the class you have to save some time for your class than, you have to save some time for your self and for school work. Not all the time it will be about you. There needs to be some time for something else more important.

In conclusion, I think Student will not benefit from able to attend classes at home. It's a lot of responsibility to remind your self that have to attend class at home, do all your work and turn it in on time. We wont have a teacher with us (personally), we have to do all our work independently. That's why I think it's not a good idea for students to attend classes at home.                                      ",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.3,1

First of all, it is easier to search information. It became to help to students and teachers too, because, it is easier for students to search different information form different topics or classes. Also, the teachers can send information or assignment to the students and they can check it at the moment.

Consequently, they can save time. They can use many tools that help to do easy the work. use the Google translate it is one of the tools more important for some students that the English is their second language, because, it is fast to search the wolds on it.

Third reason, it is useful manage a different social media to be informed in some areas. The students can share information about the different programs, event or sports game that they have in the school. furthermore, it is a manner to keep them involved in the different events at that schools.

Finally, i think the schools should permit or allow cells phone to the students during the classes' period because, it is easier to search information, they can save time to find the new worlds using the Google translate, and manage social media to be informed in some areas.",2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.7,1

One place that I would like to visit is the Bahamas. Bahamas has one of the most incredible views in the world for example the oceans and their colorful fishes they have in, the wonderful long mountings, and the the breezy weather they have there with the colorful tasty food. There are so many activities you can choose to do there for example mounting climbing, food competitions, dancing, and swimming. Some places don't have these types of activities, food, and weather.

The Bahamas is expensive, and its one of the most expensive places but it is worth it to go there for fun and entertainment. Some people would rather waste their money on other fun place for example Paris, Germany, and Italy. One thing that I would like to see when I get to the Bahamas is the wonderful culture of the Bahamas .After seeing the culture I would climb the mounting all day to just see the view from the mounting, and to see the colorful plants. Visiting the Bahamas could help me lose my stress,

and help me learn more about the cultures, and more about the language.

Some people learn new skills when they visit a new place for example cooking, climbing, skiing, and biking.

One talent that I would like to learn or become better at it is biking. I love biking that why I choose this talent, and

I could get on a biking team if I become better at it. Bahamas could help me because of its large safe streets some places don't have these types of streets and some do. I could bike throughout the whole city without getting hit by a car.

Have you ever asked your self what is it like to live in the Bahamas?

I would like to live in the Bahamas but its expensive like every other place some places are less and some places are more because of the food, views, and living. Some people live in the Bahamas even tho its expensive these people might have found a job there that pays well or they were born wealthy. Living on the beach is hard because it is expensive, and dangerous because of the storms and other natural disasters. I choose to live away from the beach because it is safer.

The benefits to working in group or working along.

The benefits to working in group are the we can't share information with other's to help amswer the problems the we working in and if i working alone i has to put my on ideas. My tree reasons to working in group are we will working all together, we get more support of the other people that are in my group and my last reason are the i will feel more relax and the tree reason that a think if i will working alone are the i has to support my ideas by my self, and if i get confuse nobaby can't help me, and my last reason are the i will feel more frustrartion to finish the work or if the idea the i put are not good. The benefit that i think can't help the student more are to work in group because we can't support other.

My first reason about working in group are the we work together and can't be more easy to finish the work in time to learn how work in group we will share some information to my group and all people that are in my group has to share some imformation i will feel more motivation to other's.

My second reason that i put the we can get more support because if we work in group we can't help each other's we lear to work in group that why a like more to working in group because some time if someone no know the answer we can't help hi or her to answer the question.

my last reason that i put in my essay are the we feel more relax because we can't not get frustrartion because the other's people that are in my group can't help us if sometime we can't get confuse to some preoblems they can't give us support to answer the problems .

That are my tree easons that why i likes to working in group that why i don't likes to work alone because some time can be more frustrartion to us and sometime we can't get more homewoork we can't give and get support because we work in to a group i think that is more easy to work in group because we can't support that ideas and we check if that ideas is good and not and coul be lest work to the other's because we can't share like one person do something and the other's person another thing about work that can't work .

2637,C3668997E921,"If I were to be asked to share a lesson with elementary school students it would be how to be respectful, to always learn and, be good communicators.

One of the first lessons I'll share with a student would be, being respectful. Being respectful is important to you and the people that surround you. For an example, you cant just go up to your teacher and tell them ""give me a pencil"" you should tell them ""may I please have a pencil"". Also if you don't be respectful to other people, people will not be respectful to you. The word ""respectful"" is not the only word you can use there's other words like nice, polite, and many other words, these ""other words"" are like branches of a tree that goes up to the main stem which is ""respect"".

Another lesson I would share would be to always learn, because in life it's always important to learn. To learn can be very hard or easy because how you learn is how you move along in life. For an example, when you first stared to walk how did you do it, by learning. Another example is, when your in school your always learning new things like math, history and, writing. Learning can be fun or boring, but in life you always need to learn for opportunities for jobs. The more you learn the better opportunities you'll get.

Lastly, being good communicators. In life you'll always have to communicate if it's your friends, teachers or your family, you'll always be communicating. For an example, I can't communicate with people, for me its very hard and every year goes by and it makes it more difficult to learn. When I came to my new school it was so hard to meet new people and I don't want anyone to suffer how I did but I learned and now I feel better I have new friends and if I never communicated then I would of just stay quite. A way for you to be a better communicator is to talk more and talk to new people, its an other great way to make new friends.

And those would be the things I would share to elementary school students to always learn, to be respectful and, be good communicators ",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.3,1

Prompt-My prompt is explain to people why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice

Seeking muitipule opinions is a better choice beacsue you can get a bunch of diffferent opinions and they most likey will have a better point of view. Its better to have mutilple choice then just having one choice or opinions now for some examples Example one If a student is having issuse at home they have mutiple opinions which are 1. talk to a counsler 2. talk to the school social worker 3. talk to a trusted adult 4. talk to a friends parent 5. talk to other family members..

example two a lady haves a few job offers but he goes for one and thinks he not going to pass the interview but he stll has a few jobs lining up behind him the job offers are1. sceintest at nasa 2. host on the ellen show 3. a buisness owner.

I also feel like asking one person would not be the best choice bescause what if they dont have have the best opinions or best advice,i feel like for the bst advice ask more then one person make sure the person is trustable make sure the person knows what they are talking about.

To make sure this trusted person know what they are talking about ask them a few quetions iif they answer them right then they might be a person you can trust

I'm saying it because of some of my experiences with other people that I met and change my impressions about them. Sometimes people don't change,instead of saying that people change your impressions about them maybe you need to know your self first and see what is happening also you need to known why that person change your impressions because maybe something sad or bad is happening on their life and you don't know it.

So let me tell you an experience that happen to me a few moths ago so I met this girl and she was very nice with me and I start thinking that she was that nice with everyone and no I was wrong she only was that nice with me so I decide to date her so I tell her if she want go to see a movie next weekend and she tell me, yes! and I say great so like 3 days before going to see the movie she start acting weird and I ask her if she was OK? and she tell me yes,so the next day I start talking with her and she tell me what was happening and she tell me that her mother was sick and she was sad,so she tell me everything that was happening and I understand why she was acting weird.

In conclusion my impressions about her it was starting to change but I decide to talk with her to see what was happening, before that I start saying that she change and my impressions about her change. is bad to change the impressions about a person without knowing what is happening in their life,because you don't know if that person is waiting for you to ask them what is happening. So I think you should ask that person what is happening and then you decide what are you going to do.

Seccond, when i go see my mother and brothers in my contry for the first time the impressions they put in ther faese whas so happy to see me one more time after 7 years.

538,293A93F037A7,"I agree with Winston Churchhill because without failure how can we be succesfull in life. Frist, reason why because If you fail at something you can reflect on it. Second, failure can make you become better then you were yesterday if you work hard. Third, Is never let failure consume you. Instead use failure to lead you to success.

You can always reflect on somthing you fail at, and become better. If, you don't study yourself at something you failed at, then you can't become successfull. For example, say you were playing a football game, and you missed your tackle in the game. After the game you watch the film, and see what mistakes you did wrong. After you seen what was wrong in film. You studied the film, and trian harder in practice for next game, so that won't happen again. Another reason you can do after you reflect on yourslef is practicing at something you love to do. For example, riding a bike for the frist time without trianing wheels. If you fail at riding a bike, then you have to practice, so you can become better at it. In order to practice you have to reflect on it frist. After you reflect what you did wrong, then you will become better when you practice.

Failure can teach you to become better then you were yesterday if you work hard. For example, you went to practice for a 100 meter, but you did not wram up at all. You decided to run the 100 meter for the frist time anyway. After you finsh the 100 meter you didn't feel good about the time you had. The next day you decide to warm up, and work harder to get better results. After your trianing you wanted to run a 100 meter. When you ran a 100 meter you felt better with your time, and decided to work harder everyday to become better then you were yesterday. This is how failure is making you better because it is teaching you that if you fail at something, you can always pick it back up, and become better, then what you were doing that day when you failed at something. If you want to become better, then you were yesterday. Then don't worry about the past because thinking about it all the time will bring you back to failure. For example, say you are mad that you lost your 100 meter race in fourth place. When you lost, you keep thinking about it all the time, and can't move forward for the next race. When the next race starts the day after you lost. You lost the race again in fourth place because you keep thinking about the race you lost in the past, then thinking about how can you can become better then you were yesterday. The point is in order to become better you have to think how can you improve better for the future, then thinking about how you failed in the past.

Never let failure consume you. Instead use failure to lead you to success. For example, say you have a math test on Monday, but you decide on Sunday to not study for it because you think the test is very easy. On Monday you give up on a math test, and decide to fail it. The reason why because you did not study, and it was too hard for you. You decide to retake it on tuesday, and learn from your mistakes. On Tuesday after you failed the math test. You took the test again to get a better score because you studied very hard to succesed in the test. This is why you always use failure to lead you to success. If you let failure consume you, then you won't reach to the top to become successful. For example, you can't swim at all, and your drowing. For some reason you dont won't to reach the top because you are depressed, and want to give up.

In conclusion, I still believe It is impossible to be succesfull without failure. Without failure we cannot reach the top to be successful. Without failure we cannot reflect on things to become better. Without failure we cannot become better then yesterday. In order to become successful we have to use failure to lead us to success. Its okay to fail because after you learn from it. Everything is going to be okay when you overcome it, and be better. ",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.5,3.0,1
1782,86E335C1EB06,"Is it a good idea for a young students to commit to a career in high school? It's a great idea so students can work on there career, and not need to focus on what they don't need in high school, to work towards their career. Reasons I agree are, they may want to follow their parents choice in career, can use school courses to excel in career choice, and why it's a good idea to start a young age.

They can follow their parents choice in career. That can be a easy choice for many people, because the student can ask for advice from their parents. They can ask their parents what courses' they took as a young student as they once were. The reader may be asking ""what if their parents' didn't go to high school?"" that can be true and what if the career the parents' have isn't for the student to follow. Then they don't have to follow their parent career, and they can choice their own career, or any close family members, or anyone they look up to, and would like to be as close as possible as them when their older. You can always just follow your own career and can start a generation for your family to follow your example.

If the parent choice didn't work they can choose what classes they can take to help them reach the career the student wants. Schools are all different so not all of them will have the same courses. Example if you want to be a chef and some sort of cook, you can take a cooking courses for the year. The teacher can show you how to prepare a dish and how to present. There are so many choices in career's you can pick from. If you want to be a engineer you have to take your four main classes Math,Science,History,English. These classes will help you in the long run through high school years. The more experience you get from this courses will give you in vantage to the other student that choice your career later in their high school years.

Finally the last reason, why it's a good idea to start early. It's pretty simple that you don't have to worry about what your career is going to be. It can be a lot easier if you know what you want to be, you can already plan the courses you would like to take. When people ask you ""what are you going to do when your done with school?"" you would say ""it's none of your business will see in the years to come!"". You shouldn't say that it's just rude to say. When someone does say that you would have a answer and you should say it proudly. You would just focus on what you need to do. Don't let anyone distract you on what you want to do.

Conclusion on why it's a good ideal for students' to have a career choice in their younger age. Following parents or close family member to the career they choice. If their career choice isn't for you, make a career you can follow and want to follow. Taking courses in school that can help you excel in career that you picked for yourself. When asked that question on what your going to be, you'll be ready answer it.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.4,1
2248,A84FFDD09442,"The positive attitude is the key to success in the life, because a person with good attitude good energy always is accepted, a person with positive attitude always is happy, because they believe thta everything is possible, that people with good energy they trasmite good energy to everyone around they, the positive attitude os the key to success in here reasons why: More effective in the job,

better relationship with family and friends and good life in general.

Positive attitude is more effective in the job, because we have to believe in our self for example; Generic_Name is working in a company they have a big project and everybody say This is too much we cant do this all this is wrong but Generic_Name say all is possible in a teamwork, is very effective if all the pieces are good nothing cant be wrong Generic_Name always have good attitude and is that why the boss always say go and ask for help to Generic_Name.

A person with positive attitude is a support, for example: Generic_Name have a big problem, but Generic_Name have a friend and her friend is her support, because with somebody is in problems need friends with good energy positive attitude. People with positive attitude always have good friends, because they listen that problems and them say All is going to be fine just wait for the right time.

My mom always say Believe in God and be positive.

After the rain the calm come. All the people say In the life all have to be positive because if i have to do something and i do my best with my best attitude, im going to be fine with the result, because i give everything. For example: Generic_Name want to be part of the marine she love the Marine, but her parents said is too much difficult is impossible for youa but Generic_Name have positive attitude.

The positive attitude always is going to be the key to success in life, because it is the base of everything all the peoples have to believed, is dosent matter what other people say or do, because in the future the only responsible for the things is going to be you nobody also. In the life that people have to show the better face and smile and say everything is possible,but no only said, that people have to believe that. All the people have to put a positive attitude and their job, school, home and in the general life and are going to be the things change.

sometimes in the life that people need a push and a person with positive attitude can be that push.

If a person dont have positive attitude that person always is going to do everything wrong, because if a person dont believe in herself nobody can do it.",3.0,2.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.9,1

I choose this question question because working at the zoo it can be hard because you do a lot of things. I think it is hard because yo have to be going one place to another.

224,10D0BBF44479,"I believe that we have to work for our goals, and also we have to focus in what we want in our life. and that is true that we accomplish more if we are always doing something, because we maintain our mind occupied in our goals or what we want to be, we could accomplish more things if we focus in our goals and don't waste our time doing other stuff.

For example: In our school we can do awesome things with hard work or if we try to concentrate just in our goals. that is get good grade, and graduate and if we keep doing good job in school we can accomplish many great things. like if we get a good career we can get good money and we can enjoy life because we are doing the things that we like not just a simple job.

Another example: Once we decide what our goal is we maintain our mind occupied in our goal and work hard to get there, or to accomplish that we really want, and not matter how hard it is we can do it. because it what we want to be, is what we like, and also is to get a good future and a good life, like if we get a good job we can get good money and we don't have to worried about that and just enjoy life and try to work hard everyday.

Another reason that why I think we have to maintain our self doing something we like. is because we can get trouble to accomplish want we want. like we can do drugs and drink alcohol and all that kind of stuff and I think that is bad for our life because that interrupt our way and we get distracted and loss our path and our faith for our self because for just one mistake we can loss all the think that we had worked for. and I think we have to focus if we really what to be a professional person of if we want to be someone in the future.

In the other hand other people think that inactivity also serve a purpose like we can live our life no matter if we do something, or not like if we don't work hard for our goals its fine, and some people say that what happen in your life is for a reason or like is your destiny. but i think that they are wrong because we can decide what we going to be in our life, that's why God left us the free will to have the opportunity to choose what we going to fight for, and make a decision that going to help us to accomplish whatever we want in this life.

In conclusion I believe that we can accomplish many awesome and great things if we work hard for our goals and maintain our mind doing something good and something that we love like in our jobs, our school, our career etc. also if we maintain our mind occupied in something productive at the same we win something because its help our life and also we have to be careful to don't get distracted for others bad things like drugs, alcohol etc.

I believe we have to take care to our life like a treasure because this life is what God give us and we have to be careful the decision we take and if we get wrong we can learn from our mistake, and I think is wonderful how much may be done if we are doing something that we like.

First, i usually learn some knowledge about nurse in books or online. There's some books that people write their experience about how could they become a nurse, how the nurse job looks like and also some story that they have met. Actually i know, it's a hard job to learn, even my first language is not English, it become harder. But when i see the story, see the interesting experiment, i'm fascinated. Sometimes, i also go to find some volunteers about nurse, it always help me learn a lot that i can't learn from the book.

Second, i think to be a nurse is arrogant. People always say "" Nurse is just like an angle"", they help people from disease. As i said, i have read a story that makes me shake: Once in a night, the nurse was ready to finish her work, but suddenly, a man run in to the hospital and there's blood in his arm, he said somebody want to hurt him, that nurse keep him in to the restroom and called 911 first, she try her best to bind up his arm, she wrote in the book"" I'm so scary and my hand was shaking, but soon i clam down, i know i'm the hope for him"". This story makes me have different understanding about nurse, this job can even save people's life. What a mighty job it is!

they should only put the one hour in for the kids that need help or catch up with there missing work and that will help more for them because it would benefit them more but after all the day i think they shouldn't put that extra hour but like i said only if kids need help they should put the extra hour in.

after all they shouldn't make it an hour because its really not worth it if we already have a long day of school they should just take electives away so school can go more faster and just get it over it also just get our education faster.        ",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.7,1

I was a clear example of this situation, last year I take an online course and of course it benefit my self a lot. How I get benefit: well first I pass the class that I was needing. It makes you feel more comfortable, because you're attending to class from home. It is more flexible, what I means with flexible you have more time to work in other things, also you have the option to turn in the homework a little later, one last thing you administer you time whatever you like.

Main reason why I would like to accomplish being decisive, is because it effects the way I think, for example; ''What if I'm writing this essay, and I include some other thing that doesn't have to do anything with the prompt I'm meant to be writing about?"" Then, I erase everything and start again, I sit for more then 20 minutes and end up with the worst decision.

I been working on this for a long time time now, and it's not easy, I ask myself if it's this possible.

""Determine never to be idle."" He thought that is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something, and that we can accomplish more if we are a active person because the inactivity also serve a purpose in every person life.

First,It is awesome has the determination to decide how to do or what do you want to do in your life,because something we may know what we need to do but we don't take a decision to done it. And the reality is that we don't gonna know how much can be done if we don't try to do the things that we wants or needs to done.

Second,everyone has the option of accomplish much more than we think,if we are always doing something,for example,finalize any plan or idea that comes to our heads in any moment,time,or second of our lives. The big thing is never stop doing the things that we wants to achieve,and be proud of what you receive.

Third,we have the option to choose between doing something or stay inactive,because inactivity also serve a purpose. This is the big deal ,sometimes we don't imagine that we prefer do nothing without see it, we don't see what we are doing at the time. That's the power of inactivity.

To fallow this model of conserve energy and resources we have to know the reason to adopt if this model can benefit or not the school , following this model the school can confront many problems also can have many benefits but there are many reasons why the school have to follow this model and why school don't have to follow,

First,

we will talk about the disadvantages, extending two hours to the school days will be weary for the students, students will gonna be tired in the classroom and that's not benefit the students, if having eight hours in a regular week students feel tired, so adding two hours to the class days will be disastrous to the students.

Students, teachers would be affect by this changes the reason why can be affect is because they will not have time to pass with their families or things that they need to do after school.

Many students from school works to help their families or because they are living alone and they need to work to provide their personal things,

so they will not have time and that's will be a reason why they can left the school.

Students from the sports teams, club members will be affect because most of their activities are after school,so if the school adopt the new model that is adding two hours to the regular calender all they can be affected because of time.

Teachers also can be affect because they have personal life they need to grade the students work and in this new calender they can't do all.

People who works in schools will be affected because they will have one day off of their regular week.

Parents and Students will not feel comfortable they can be disagree with this change and this can cause conflict with the school principle and this can bring many other conflicts follow this model can bring many changes where the students can be benefits by this change of the new calender, also teacher people who works in school can be benefit.

One reason can be the four days of school that means the students will have three days off.

Students can have more time to do the homework because most students work during the weekend and they don't have time to do the homework so they will have an extra day to do all the things that they need to do.

students can learn more and this can be a reason to change the calender, adding two hours to the schedule will help the students because they will have more time to learn.

Also teachers can be benefit because also they have to evaluate the students and they have just the weekend to do that and that is short time , so they will have one day to grade and do all that they need to do.

all the the people are benefit because they have time to pass with their families or do whatever that they need to do, a lot of students work so they can work in this extra day.

In conclusion extending the school days and the four days of school week have many benefits and many disadvantages . As we can see there many things that can benefit the school but also there are many disadvantages .

I think the school have to be stay with the same calender, actually the schedule works great so I think there is no reason why we have to change. ",3.0,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.1,1

Probably prefer to have a elective clase because they are learning what they like, and will be less difficult for them to understand the class. In my positon students should be required to take elective classes because they attend to school every day, students are teach in what they want to learn and students are much success in class.

Many students do not attend to school in order to not have a clase that they do not like. Students that use to not attend school is when he/she have a class that is not intresting to learn; they may think that the class is not important enough to help them in a future, and letting students to take elective classes probably will stop the absence of many kids because they will want to know new things about the class . Furthermore if students have an elective class they will have that exicitement to start the class on time and not be late, neither to miss school any day because of their interest of learning .

Students should be guide in what they may think is useful and much helful for them. In some school people had heard that many students are teach In things that may not be needed in life like art, some students take art because they like that clase and problably because In the future they Might be plaining to become an art teacher, but for others is preferable to select an elective class that will manage her/ him to be succsessful. As a result of take an eletive class can be a tool for students to discover what subject is most important for them to have knowledge and have the passion of keep learning.

Students who take elective classes have the advantage of learn what is interesting for them , and be succsess no just in class also might be helpful for students in a future.

Music have a lots of types it could be happy, sad, angry and etc, and it make you feel like that. We hear music everywhere on TV, in music class,and etc. When we hear music we get our emotions out and make our mind light, and we enjoy that.

At last, I think school is a place of learning, if someone want to learn something he always enjoy everyclass and get something learn from it. We should always enjoy at school and learn something. Because school is our main resourse of learning.                                      ",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.8,1
3285,E429DAB69106,"what would happen if older and younger students get paired together? If younger and older students get paired together it would have a good effect on students because they can learn different methods of learning, give advise for what do expect in high school, and learn different ways of managing stress.

the first reason why it's a good idea to pair older and younger students together is because they can learn different methods of doing things. older students can show the younger students there ways of learning. younger students can ask questions when they don't understand something on their homework, and the older students can show them how to answer the questions and show them their skills. Other thing is that the students can show the younger students short cuts on any subject they need help with. When the older students show the younger students their ways of learning it will help them when they don't understand something.

The second reason why is that the older students can give advise for what do expect in high school. They can tell the younger students how much homework they will have and how hard it is. They can also tell them what classes they might enjoy. They might enjoy theater or cheer. The younger students can tell them what classes they want to try out. Other reason is that they can tell them the skills they should and need to known. it's a good idea to be prepared for high school and the older students can help them with that.

Finley the older students can show them how they mange stress. They can give some advise on how they take a test. they can tell them their test strategys. Other thing they can do is show them how to prepare for a test. older students can show them how they study for a test. and the last reason is the older students can tell them how they mange there time. they might tell them them what time they do things and how they sent up their work space. when the students known some ways of managing stress it will help them in high school.

thesis are all the reason why it's a good idea to pair younger and older students together because students can learn different methods of leaning, get advise for what to expect in high school, and show them different ways of managing stress. when older and younger students get paired together it's a different experience that is good to have.

If you do everything with your phone you can loose you vision beacuse the telephone has to much light, but you can play the games and not talking with nobody.

for example in this time the parents when their children start crying they just give them the cell phone, why they do that beause they now the kids gonna addicted to wacht videos then that gonna be a problem with the kids when they grow up they don ganna talk with nobody but that not de kids fall beacuse they parents teach then how to use the cell phone but they dont teach them how to talk with people, they need to lear how to talk with older people or teach them how to do other stuff.

this is another example when parents go to the shopping stores and they are in the store they losse their kids they are always in the phone they never can missed call but they can missed their kids that not make sense because when they found the kids they star to saying thing.

my opinion is we need to talk more share our ideas or meet more friend that better to be everyday in the phone talking with people's like my mother always told me dont tlak with bad people but the thing is we never now when they are bad but that why we need to do everything carefull, is better to meet peoples in person.

Others don't want to share what happens in their life for examples.

The best way to show other people is to give them one example about your own experience. There are many other ways but example is more important. You let other people know something that you have learn it. For example, My parents are taking about them self last night their was taking about how can I influence my family in the future.

What you learned from that examples in your life. Give other examples from what you learn in your own life would be a good way to influence that people. There are many people that are passing about what you had passing through. For example,Angie my best friend is in drugs and I don't want that she happens what happen to me. So, I give her a example about my experience in drugs that what happens to me is going to happen with her if she continue to consuming drugs.

People who change for others . There is a lot of ways to become you.

When you know who you want to be as a person thats when you pick up traits. When you want to be something you start learning things. You can't have character if you don't want to be someone. Character traits are things people notice about you. Like right now there are to Women right now one is dressed nice has done her hair. She like to be fancy she blow her nose outside.

3472,ED81EC443A69,"I remember one summer vacation, that my family and I took, where we went to another state to visit another relative that we haven't seen in awhile. Summer vacation had been the same for many years, summer vacation is when teenagers take a break from school to enjoy what they like to do during their free time. By having a long summer vacation, does not affect students to retain information from the past. teens should know that summer vacation is when they can enjoy their break to do what they want for fun.

First reason, why teens should know that summer vacation is for them to enjoy, is because they can spend time with their family. For example, the whole family can got to another state to visit another relatives that they have not seen in awhile. By spending more time with their family; consequently, teens can be more closer to their family. Teens can also, enjoy their summer vacation with their family by playing video games, watching movies, and go on a road trip.

another reason, why teens should know that summer vacation is for them to enjoy, is that they can hangout with friends. teenagers hangs out with friends to go to a party, or to watch a movie. by hanging out with friends teens can do what they think is fun for them and their friends. For example, teens can have a fun time playing pool with their friends or just by going to a gym. In addition, teens can also have fun with their friends by having a sleep over or go for a camping trip.

Lastly, on why students should know that summer vacation, is for them to enjoy, is that they are away from school, by being away from school students can have more time to have fun and do the things that are important to them. For example, students can stay up late and does not have to wake up early in the morning. However, teens can have more time in their hands, instead of having to learn.

I feel comfortable or confident about this quote because once you already mastered something you keep feelling as if you are still missing something or maybe you think what you already have is not enougth so, you decide to start working on a different thing or proyect just to keep making grow what you have.

In this life nothing comes easy, you have to work harder to build something or what you have in mind, once you build what you got in your mind you still probbably not going to stop trying to build more than what you already have, because you already tasted hows it feel having much, so you keep going and build more and more only because you don't feel that what you got is enougth or you liked how is feel having much.

""Dreams never come throught, untill you make them happen.""

303,163A54729CAA,"Other people would say that failure is a way you learn about your mistakes and where you can improve. Being successful isn't necessarily a way of failing so much it's a way to show that your trying and trying while not giving up. I would have to agree on Mister Winston Churchill about ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" In other words, I believe being the person whos mistakes or failures is someone successful because they didn't give up they believed on they're selves and continued to work harder.

First, when you seem to fail everytime but, you just keep believing in yourself that's how you know you want to be successful and when you look back at those days in either high school,work,or even at home. You'll noticed that those days weren't perfect but, it's a way for you to learn about your failures in the end of the day you become someone whose very successful. My parents told me to always believe in myself and to never give up and if you fail over and over then get back up and do better.

Second, it's not just us people who has failures but celebrities also had failures believe it or not. Celebrities went through what we went through. Classmates either said ""your not gonna be famous your just gonna fail."" or "" Your failures won't lead you to be successful you'l only fail again."" They didn't care what they're classmates said they just kept trying and trying until they made it. For an example, Will Smith he kept trying to be successful in the acting world and he once said that if it wasn't for his parents who told him to keep trying he wouldn't be where he is. Jackson Wang, his a Chinese artist who didn't think he'd become successful but now people see him as an inspiring artist who is also in a Korean boy group. So in other words, if you keep failing then keep trying because you'll become someone someday.

In conclusion, Mister Winston Churchill is right about ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". His message about it would bring people to they're feet and not give up. Just keep trying until you made it.

In my own opinion i say i would agree in my 17 years on this earth that i have to agree because if you stay to comfortable you won't do anything in life you will want it all easy and not try to strive for the best version of yourself.

you can stay comfortable but it won't help because your just wasting time and effort that you could become a better human being and spread your knowledge with other people. You should always try to strive to become the best you can be.

I say people should agree on this because not trying to fix your or improve yourself is not the best way to go. Like they shouldn't disagree i say because it not a bad or good thing but it would be amazing to push yourself and be more educated get pain a lot for having that big of a knowledge and use it think help people that can't help themselves. us humans should help everyone we can even if it's little people sometimes don't ask for help but if they dont ask you tell them you need help.

Some people also may disagree because they might think only about themselves or they think that there at a good point that they dont have to try anymore or try there very best they think thieve mastered the problems and situations. They think that they can't learn anything else but there wrong we human beings can always learn something more strive to be better humans, father,mothers,sons,daughters etc... but the point is don't settle for okay do more.

We Should learn not to stay cozy you should try to improve a bit everyday or learn something new help yourself and help each other out if they need help or if you need it learning and talking to other people wont hurt you so like

If they don't understand or learn from there mistakes. They can't get success in there life. If anyone did any mistake try to fix it. If you can't fix it. Get help from your family or your friends.

When i was in 9th Grade. I don't like math. Because i don't understand math question. I read my question and find mistakes. What i did wrong. Then i fix my mistakes. I do my work again and again. I do my work very hard. I ask my teacher about anything that i don't understand. She help me lat to learn math. Because i did my work hard now i get the success. Now i am good in math.

When i came in United State. I don't Speak and understand English. I made many mistakes to write the work or speak. I try my best and I learn English from my teachers from my friends. Any word i don't understand i look in dictionary. If i can't find word in dictionary i ask my teachers. I speak English at home with my brother and sister they fix my mistakes and its help me to speak better English.

Some people when they loss they don't try it again. Because they think that we are not good at this. Cause of that they can't get success. peoples who are around them they need to help them motivate them so they can try it again. like Sport coaches motivate there team before they match. When someone motivate other they get energy to do something. Don't be afraid to loss next time try with more power. Everyone loss in there life and they learn from that.

Reasons why people fail. Because no one understand them so they think that no one care about them. people need to understand other problems and help them. Tell them that you make this mistake try to fix this and you will be better.

When someone break his/her leg. Then he/she is so afraid to walk. because he/she think that it's very painful. Then someone help his/her put his/her hand on the shoulder. Then they slowly slowly put weight his/her leg. Like this you don't need to lose enthusiasm in your life. When you feel failure see other people read about them that how they fight when they fail.

Many American famous people loss in there missions but they don't loss there hope. They try it again and now we are read about them. Because they did many things. Thats help us make easy and fast to do our work or travel. Like Airplane, Electricity, Computers, Cars, and many others things.

Some people fail in there life. They try again but still they fail. So try something else that easy for you and you can make your life better. Like if you are not in a basketball try soccer or baseball. which one is easy for you. Choose that and do hard work on that. practice every day don't be lazy.

I want to say that do what ever do you want to do. But do that you are good in and easy for you. If you like another thing thats hard for you. do hard work on it and make easy for you.

Although it is a great idea, only the truthful will attend classes from home while the other student will be in school. Students need to be in school to social and get out of their house, students shouldn't be in their bed listening to the teacher and being lazy all day. Student needs to be in school.

From my point of view, students should be in school to socialist and need some fresh air. If a student stay home then they'll feel lonely, decrease their social skills, and be lazy. Due to this, students can develop some type of mental health problems if they stay in their house for a while, also some student who is in home will most likely skip school just to enjoy their day off. Teachers should know their students more. If a teacher knows who wants to learn then they'll most likely will focus on that student but if the student doesn't care then the teacher will try their best to help the student. Therefore all K-12 students should be in school and learn.

Even though you understand my argument however, I think the trustworthy students should attend class at home. If a student shows respect and work really hard, then they would most likely to attend class at home if necessary. Although it is best if they attend in class but if they are sick then they are welcome to attend class in home as long they listen to the teacher and take notes. But if they are really sick or any emergency, than they should email the teacher to let them know. Students should always let the teacher know when they are not in school and ask the teacher's permission to do a video conference.

Without a doubt, students should be in school to socialist and need of fresh air, I do believe that everyone will be good in class and show respect to any adults. All student needs to be healthy in a physical and mental way. Students need to be in school in order to build their social skills because that's part of life, to socialist people if they need some assists or you need some assists as well. However, if there's a trustworthy student who work really hard may attend class in home. But if a student is awfully sick and in crisis then he or she will email the teacher that they are not in school and ask if they can do the work next class or in the morning and lunch break.

Although distance learning can effect students losing focuses in their classes, nevertheless, learning away from school can help us the students to have less stress, and giving us an opportunity to take care of our brothers and sisters and attending classes without skipping classes.

Almost everyone in school is stressing about something,so attending classes online would help a lot. For example: It gives us more time to finish our work for other class and stress less, because to me having the advantage to attend online classes would help out a lot, and also i might have other classes to worry about. so having an option for us the students to attend class from home by using online or video conferencing might not sound the worst. And could help students who are suffering from anxiety and having any type of stress. By using online classes they could listen to music to clam themselves down and not having any signs of a panic attack, because in school not every class or teachers might let the students use their phone to listen to music; they might not be able to know if the student is having a panic attack, but at home if they are attending classes online and having a panic attack their parents would be there to help them clam down.

Most students need to stay home in order to help with family emergence. Research has show that almost 50% of the time if the student is not at school, then they are at home helping out with their siblings at home, doing that they skipping school and losing an education, but with online classes they can do both without skipping class or missing anything in school. Because with online class the information they need would be provided to them, if they have a laptop or computer and in case they do not have any of these technology they can just go to their local Library with their siblings and do their assessments with no worries, because their siblings would find some kind of fun to do at the library.

In conclusion attending classes online at home would benefit a lot for us the students because in case some thing happens at home they just go online at do their work without stress about losing points, to me personal attending classes online would be very helpful because I would have to stress a lot, can skip school and get some sleep.

The things I have learned in today's day is probably not really achievable because people give up to easy and think it's hard to fix cars. I like to build and take apart engines or even add parts to get more potential out of any car I purchase. I love to race cars and also flip my money too. That all takes skill but you don't learn if your not taught in life.

Likewise myself , for 11 years my father taught me how to use his tools and fix little things on any car he had at the moment. We would sell them and flip the money beacuse we'd be the ones fixing them up a bit. When I got my very first car it had no motor in it and bought it for six hundred dollars. I myself bought the motor for a thousand and installed the whole thing by myself but yet with the right tools it was then worth five thousand because of how many miles the engine was and how clean the interior and exterior was. I would always becareful though when it came to turbo the engines. You'd need to hook a special computer on it to tune the compter of the engine so it doesn't blow up on you. I'd love to race and compete against other peoples builds for money on the track. The best part of mastering this skill is that I will never need a mechanic to fix my own car again.

Another skill I have become really good at is gaming and playing the fracnchise called Call of duty. These types of games are shooter games and it all depends on how fast your sensitivity is and how fast you can react to whatever is happening in the game. When it comes to gaming I like to post videos online of how good I am because I can also get paid through how many people watch my videos. Some people like the entertainment but more like to see how fast the reactions I have. That type of skill has helped me so much in life because it has always helped me make the right decsions when I am driving on the road even in school it has helped me remember and react a little faster then others in class. This skill improves everyday because it's affected my everyday life. Through this I've mastered to actually get through everday life without having such stress because I am always prepared to react and decide what is good for me.

All in all I agree with Ralph Waldo he is right without trying something new you won't grow at all. The human brain is mean't to be expanded and stretched like a muscle to learn new things like playing a sport , remembering equations in physics and solving over and over again and still getting logical answers , to be good at something takes practice , but to master whatever you want to master takes brilliance.

But it's their choice to come after school to finish their homework I know we want the best for them but it's their choice we can't make them come. A lot of student are failing school because they don't do their homework you just have to try it homework helps a lot like in math,science,social studies and reading class being good at every class is going to help you in college. We need after school homework clubs in our school, every school should have after school clubs it's for the best for every school we all need them after school homework clubs.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.1,1
2023,98C692B7B152,"I agree that success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm because you will be exited for your next step and you want to know whats gonna happened once you have passed.

For example if you fail on doing something, you will be exited on doing it again until you haven't pass because you might be thinking thats your dream to achieve it or its really important to achieve what i fail in it. I heard story of a guy he fail a lot but he didn't gave up because he was still interested on the experiment, so he failed like 408 time I think and he passed at 409th times so you can imagine that he was still exited and interested on that experiment that he failed 408 times and he got success at 409 times.

So in life when people failed on something they move on because they might not be interested or exited on that thing that they have failed but many other people will keep trying until they haven't achieve it. they will keep trying because they love it or they are still exited on that work that they have failed.

I know some people don't like doing one thing again and again but if you want to be success in life you have to keep doing it until you haven't achieve it because you can't be success in life without being a failure. when people failed on something they might say that its hard and i am not gonna do it again because they didn't try their best on it, but if you keep trying you will get some hint on it and it will be easier to achieve what you working on. So if you failed on something be enthusiasm on it it will help you more to be success in life.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.1,1
1168,5A977087E7E8,"Dear Principal; Changing the cafeteria lunch for a healthier lunch is a good idea. There is going to be new food, healthier food, and different types of food that others students never taste before. As a student I really like this idea because there is going to be a healthy food for all of us.

New lunch menu, having a new lunch is going to make many students happy because there are students that are getting tired of having the same lunch almost everyday, but it also can effect others students because there are many students that enjoy eating the same lunch and they never get tired, In thus case is better is you as a principal talk to the cafeteria manager and ask her for a list of wich food is the students favorite and at the end ypu and your company can decided whether you change the menu or not, but as a students I think it's also better if you just see wich food students like and take away the food that students eats the least and change that for the new food and live the food that students likes.

Students might be happy, Because you are not taking the food that students likes and also bringing different menu that students will be happy to have. We are trying different menu and that is also making us be different from others schools and they would see our school as a example, and they are going to do the same and is quit better because is not only our students that are getting tired of the cafeteria menu, there are others students in different schools that are also going trough to this issue. Schools from different states might see us and take the same idea as you have principal, that is going to halp not just the students it also helping our parents to save money, Because students that dont like the menu no more are telling their parents to buy then food from outside, and somentimes does parents dont have the money to do so. It also can help students dont skip classes to go buy from from outside bucause they dont like the food no more, that can help the students, parents, and also the school from not having a bad reputation.

Tasting different types of menu, trying new things like food is somenthing that students also loves I put my self for example. There are students that likes to try different food, the cafeteria have bad and healthy food but its not equal and for that we need a change, we need to have more healthier food, some studets are also alergit to food that is in the cafeteria and thats why they dont eat and they get sick because they eat only at home and most of the time we in school and we dont have the opportunity to go out and buy food. Bringing healthy and different lunch menu is good, becase we are able to taste differnt food and healthier, students wont need to get out of class just to go and buy food from outside, its dangerous that just for students that skip it also for our parents, Because the school call and let our parents thet we skip and they get worry for you fo not letting then know where you are or what are you doing.

My conclution is that students are going to be happy if you just ask the cafeteria manager fo a list of wich food students loves the most, and one of wich one they like the least. Thats is going to help all students to be conform with the new changes that you wants to do, students are going to have their favorite food and others students wont need to skip class to go out and buy food, parents won't be worry no more and students are not going to take any risk of getting sick because they dont eat. Healthy food it can help us with many things like, your body, less fat, and more proteins are going to be in our body. Parents won't have to buy food for the kids no more and they are going to save money, Changing the school menu is a great idea that most of the students are going to understand, and for the one that don't they are going t get used to it. Thats going to help every students and people from outside are goin to see the changes in the school and others schools should start doing the same for their students. Healthy life with less risk of everything. This is my sincerity opinion and hopefully the Principal takes some ideas of what the students think and what is the best for all of us.

The president Thomas Jefferson wrote ""it is wonderful how much may be done if we are doing."" what these means is if your always work, even for society or for your self. Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something,or does inactivity also serve a purpose?. Some says inactivity serve a purpose because is a rest to get strong and keep working. Although some say always doing something is better because if you always work hard you get your goals and you are productive to the society.

Millions of people wake up every morning to work give all of them and make their best doing work, but what about people who don't work. Even if you can't find a job you can rapport to the society or your growth as a person. you can do social work or help people, you have to be an active person. Is important to say everybody needs to rest, but if you get to much rest you won't be able to reach your dreams and goals.

Do something always is good if your doing good things, work hard and passionate for what your do every person who work is for something. they want to reach goals dreams some of them got to pay to much thing or some of them just love work and make money or support your family. everybody works for something and that makes them work. My mom always tell me if you want something go for it, make it happen all of us needs a good future a better future, thats why you always have to do something. It is the reason why is better doing something than nothing.

Lets talk about the society view. In society you have to do something even if you have a dream or not because you gotta eat, where to live, pay bills, taxes and any needs that you have to cover so you have to have a job. And not just a job you can do other things to always do something like i said before help people that makes you growth as a person, and even tho is free or they pay you if you love what your do, or love to do a productive human for the society you will consider do good things.

Do something is important in the humanity because that makes these world work and grow up. dreams and goals make people do what their do. think about if you are a productive person or you does inactivity may be changes your mind. in conclusion the president Thomas Jefferson give us these quote to think about what do we do or what we should do on our life. Is good to take a break, but don't forget you have goals an dreams that you have to make them reality.    ",3.0,2.5,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,1

Some people believe students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home, however, home school is a great way of student to attend classes because they can focus in their studies, it's more safer, and they can avoid bad influence from others.

Attending classes through online or video conferencing has a lot of benefits like what I mention from the first paragraph, that homeschooling can help students to focus in their studies. For some reasons, some students that go to school can't be focused on their studies/activities because they are distracted by some of their classmate that is very naught. For instance, there are some people that born in this world that are very naught, like even you defy him/her they will not listen to you and then sometimes, some of the other students will raise their pride and just walkout from their class because they don't want to listen any objection from their action. Another reason for home schooling is that, it's more safer for them to study. For example in today's society, a lots of bad things happening in the world, like school shootings that cause a lot of innocent students to die, like what happened in Florida, a few months ago. One of the reason also of homeschooling is that, they can avoid bad influence from others. Like for example, some of the school are diverse ethnic, students characteristics are diverse also, like some of the other likes to go shopping mall, likes to strolling anywhere, likes to bully others, likes to fight, likes to not go home after school instead go to other houses that they don't really even that much know, and many more characteristics.

Although students will have benefits of attending classes from school, however, attending classes from home has much more benefits. Attending classes from home by the way of online or video conferencing can really benefit to the students because one of the biggest benefits is that, they are more safer to study in their homes, they have a great time to focus in their studies, and they can avoid bad influence from others.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.1,1
2473,B7FABBC13A0F,"""Character is something what you yourself choose to make it""

I agree with John Lubbock because our character is something we make by ourselves. We make ourselves the person we become in the future. We choose our traits and characters by ourselves. Everyone has a right to choose what's best for themselves. Some people choose worst traits but others choose good. It depends on ourselves what we want to be in the future. Although some traits in a character of a person comes from experiences and most of the time bad traits comes from the worst experiences in our life. But it is completely our choice if we want to make those bad experiences a process of learning and learn something good from them. Some people choose to learn worst possible things from their experiences that's how most of the people get their worst traits. It is not wrong to say that people choose what they want to be and how they want their life. It is true that some traits are formed beyond our control but it depends on ourselves if we want those trait in our characters or not.

Some people get too comfortable with bad traits and they don't want to change their selves for example lying is a worst trait anyone can possibly have it leads to do things that we don't even want to do but we do it anyways because we get comfortable and have no fear. ""Lying is not better than silence"" so it is way better to not say anything than lie about it. Lying is something that leads to other bad traits like dishonesty. If a person is not honest than they are not trustworthy. Trust is something very important because it is extremely hard to gain.

If a person is not trustworthy than there is nothing they can do other than try not to lie. Trust is like a glass if it breaks it will never be the same. All these problems are caused by lying and it depends on our to choose if we want to lie and make ours characters full of worst traits or be a better person choose good traits. In this world there is nothing more important than being who we are and choosing best for ourselves.

Our characters can formed by influences beyond our control for example something bad that happened in the past can lead a person to lie and being dishonest. Lying is not something to be proud of and bad experiences doesn't give anyone the right to lie because it doesn't matter. There is a huge difference between right or wrong. We choose our traits and what we want our characters to be like by ourselves we should know what's good and bad for ourselves. Even though sometimes being honest and speaking truth can lead to difficult situations and most people don't want to deal with difficult situations which is okay but it is important to do something right. Difficult situations make a person stronger and traits like honesty will make us proud of ourselves in future. Most of times its the journey that matters the most than the destination because it not about how we choose to become a better person it is about the experiences that led us to who we will be in the future. It is about how some people choose to learn worst possible things from their experiences but others learn good things from them. It is true to say that we become what we want to be and we choose our traits by ourselves. The harder the path will be the stronger the person becomes so it depends on ourselves to choose good or bad. There will be always two paths one will lead to good and other will lead to bad although our it depends on our own selves to choose from right or wrong,good or bad the choice is ours. If we want to be become something we'll be proud of or something we will be ashamed of. We write our stories by ourselves so it is all on in our hands what we want to be.

Although some people might disagree and yes it is true that our characters can formed by influences beyond our control but it depends on us what we want to be. Everyone knows the difference between right or wrong. There will be consequences of choosing bad and sometimes it will be easy to not be brave and choose the worst traits for ourselves. It is completely your decision if you want to add good traits in your personality or bad traits. The difference between Joker and Batman is that Batman chose good traits while Joker turned himself evil by choosing bad traits. Even though tragic experiences led Joker to be evil but his past didn't give him the right to be evil. So,you can't be evil because of your past and becoming a better person or having good traits will lead to a better future because it past is past and future is something to look forward to. Traits like honesty and being able to do what's right without any fear will make us proud of ourselves in the future. Everyone wants to be proud of themselves and to make that possible they need to adapt good traits. Good traits will lead to success and a better future which is very important to for ourselves. Bad traits will lead to an unsuccessful future and which is not best for anyone. It is important to choose good traits.

In conclusion the person we choose to become today will reflect on our future selves whether we choose good or bad traits. The decision is ours and what we want to be ourselves to be like it totally depends on us. Most of the problems in our lives can be solved by choosing good traits over evil. Good traits will lead to success and a better future which is very important to for ourselves while bad traits will lead to an unsuccessful future and which is not best for anyone. It is very important to choose good traits. If you want to be proud of yourself then it is a must to choose good traits. Our traits make our characters and personalities. Some people make their life miserable by choosing what's worst for them like bad traits. It is important for ourselves to choose good rather that ruin our lives with choosing something like bad traits. A person can ruin their character by choosing bad traits. That's why it is extremely important to choose good traits for ourselves because it is good.               ",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.2,1
984,4B6DF39107CC,"Is it a good idea to graduate high school in three years instead of additional four year? Based on my experiance in high school, i disagree with students who graduate high school in three years, besause students can take college credits while they have short schedual on their senior year, and also they can get into the clubs that would give them the idea of that they would do after the graduations. In order to graduate high school in three years students must take summer school, give up on their elective courses, and give up on their vacations.

Students have to take three years of summer school in order to graduate high school early. They are required to complete all the credits that is neccessary for graduations. They must complete the requirements for graduation before it is too late. If the students chooes to skip one year of summer school credit they cannot graduate in three years, and they will have rough time trying to cought up. If they still got lazy than there is no other way to graduate then four years plan. This is where their whole stuggles end up, and they still have to be in school for the fourth year.

Students have to give up on their electives during their high school year to graduate. They will have full schedual of requirements to finish up. They have to work hard, do all the work for all of their classes, turn in almost every homework for their classes. They will be struggling during school year since they do not have an elective class that they will be not hard to think about, also some schools offers courses that would give students the ideas for their college life, such as Generic_School. It is an engineering courses that give the students idea of what they would do if they want to be an engineer.

Students will give up on their summer vocations because they will be taking summer school to graduate high school in three years instead of additional four year. However students will be doing their school stuff while others will be celebrating their vocations. Students who want to finish up their schools early, they will be attending summer schools. Becide it they also be working, and maybe they wonld not have time to complete their assignments on time, it will make them to change their opinnoin on early graduation, they will give up on their early graduation plan.

To conclude, it is not the best choice to graduate high school in three years, additionally students would have rough and tamble time trying to finish high school. Therefore, it will be better if they stick with a normal school time and finish high school in four years, it will help them to get more knowledge, and better undrestainding of that they would do for their oncoming life. For the majority of people its better to graduate high school in four years, even though if they are aiming for advance deploma they will need to take full four years of high school, and summer school as well, but if the students are going for standard deploma they will have short schedual, and they can take advantage if it and take college credits for free on their senior year.

1256,60CCF0F2DF38,"Dear Winston Churchill,

I strongly believe that, failure plays a huge role in pursuing success, and I have a personal story and also information to back up my statement ""that failing is the key to success"".

The news article of daily life, had a section dedicated to failing is a key to success, in that portion it talks about how the most successful people in the world had to fail so many times and hardship in that portion of the article it interviews Bill Gates and he quote on quote said that ""failing thought me that you have to try harder and harder every time you fail in order to successed"", and without failing he would not be the CEO of Google.

I personally have experienced how failing is the key to success. I started playing football in my freshman year in high school. I was trying so hard to get a starting position on the football team. I was doing really bad during team practice, and one day my coach came up to me and told me that I should quit football, and how it was not the right sport for me. So I got cut from the team but I did not listen to what my coach said to me. I kept practicing over the off season working harder then ever. When sophomore season came up and we had to go through tryouts in order to make the team. I was doing really good in the first two days of the tryouts but then I started doing really bad on the third day, and then the coach came up to me on the last day of the tryouts, and told me that I did not make the team. I started feeling really hopeless but I still did not gave up and kept working harder and harder. On my junior season it was time for the football tryouts once again. I started doing really good, and the coaches were really impressed of what I was capable of doing. Last day of the tryouts the coach came up to me, and told me that he was really proud of me. He was really surprised that I didnt gave up, and after that he told me I made the team as a starting defensive tackle.

In conclusion this is why I strongly agree that failing is a key to success, without failure we as human beings would not be able to improve in our day to day life. It is because of failing which keeps us successful, and makes us humans work harder for what we want in life.

First reason is there a lot of people in the world who has a lot of problems. so I think that this quote would light up there day and make them fell better. second reason is that people that dose not have any problems could save this quote in there brains and when they are facing a problem they could use it to help them through that time and to do better. lastly I think when Duke Ellington was going through trough times he used his own straghe to help him to do his best and not give up.

Next reason why you should agree with Duke Ellington is that when people have a lot of problems most of them just give up for example most people dose not have enough money to pay there bills some sell their house while others sell the cars and most people become homeless and live in the streets but if the hear this quote it might help them not to give up and do there best.

My final reason why everyone should agree with Duke Ellington quote is it's hard going through a problem because any thing can happen some people lose there jobs because of a problem.

2316,AC9719A6A375,"is setting a good example by your own behavior the best way to influence other people i agree that setting a good example by your behavior is the best way to influence people when giving a good example your trying to influence and direct the people so you must have a good behavior in order for them to be persuaded, you must also have good details to provide to the people or your clients,and good examples can guide you to next step or level.

when setting a good example for other people you want them to be to be persuaded, and to follow the example. so you must have a good attitude and a good behavior. when providing a information to other people you have to make sure that what your saying make sense and its accurate. i have a little brother that wants to play basketball just like me, every game i have he come and watches me play, the moves he see me do in the game, if he likes it hes gonna tell me and when i get home i show him the examples on how to do those specific moves. when you show good examples people will folow and will be pass those examples down to somone else.

good examples can guide you, to the next step or level. when i'm taking a test at school, it always begins with a three question example and it lets me know what i am going to be dealing with, so when I take the test i know what i am going to be expecting on the test ,and i am also gonna know what to do on the test. examples can help a lot of people succeed. when your working on any school work or classwork it always starts with an examples on how to show you how to answer the problems and do it. little examples can provide people with a lot of information. if you pay attention to the examples it can really help you in the future. some lawyers use examples when talking to a judge in court to help them understand or to persuade them.

when providing information to other people you want to make sure your attitude and behavior is on point in order for them to listen. my parents sometimes have trouble using technology so when they need help i'm ready to show them examples on what they are having trouble on, they know they can always count on me,and that is the type of behavior if they ever need any help. a lot of people doesnt tolerate poor behavior. when my English teacher is giving the class an example on what we are going to do later that day she makes sure that each and one of his understands what we are doing before she moves on. the source that your providing you have to make sure it actually or if it can other people out.

although some people may say giving a example with your own behavior may not work for a lot of people. another way you can show an example, is by showing them in person. I sometimes have trouble making or creating something so i got to watch someone else do it in order for me to do it. showing direction to people in person will make it somewhat easier for the the person to understand,instead of just telling them. you can influence other upon your action and they might follow id your attitude is good.

Some peoples opinions can support your choice or can go against your choice. Getting other people's opinion can help someone think of a better choice and make that choice more helpful to that someone.

Why getting other people's opinions can help someone make a better choice or think of a better choice is because, people can tell you the same thing but in a different wording. Having different opinions can make someone think of a better choice because people give that someone ideas of the choice they're going to make. Having more opinions does help a lot because they could make someone's choice more beneficial and help someone's way of thinking about better choices, having less people wouldn't really want to persuade someone to make better choices and it wouldn't be that make someone think of a better choice. The more opinions people give someone, the more likely the choice will be or they will think of a better choice.

Opinions can persuade someone to make a better choice because a good friend or a good person can give his opinion that would make someone want to make a better choice having lots of good opinions can benefit someone's choice and make better choices. Having two or one opinion doesn't persuade someone to make better choices but having five or eight people could make someone want to make better choices because people can be very persuasive and some people wouldn't really listen or care what one or two people say but if its at least five or more then there is chance of that someone might listen or even care because lots of friends and family or even teacher want that someone to make better choices and he or she can't just ignore that unless they want to make bad choices. Having advice from close ones can be helpful to because they can persuade someone to make choice that will benefit their life and ensure that they will not regret that choice they made in the future.

598,2D508127DEF1,"There is a debate today day about whether the students should study from home or school. Many people agree that the appropriate way to study is going personal to the school. My idea is that they are well understanding when the students go to the school because they have mutiple attention. Here are some reasons why many students master a course in school rather than online courses. First they can ask questions at any time, second improvement on learning new topics, and last friends support in group work.

First, many teenagers who take online courses still have questions or guesses on their answers. Here some reasons why many on the students does not master some courses. The classes related with Math, Chemistry, and History are the complicated for most learners. Those who are assisted by a teacher are the ones with the chance of clarify any problem related with numerical or logic problem; also the teenagers can make corrections in their work by asking for solutions. While the students with online courses are involved with more guesses, but the course program does not provide clear answer or does not provide an answer.

Second, the improvements in schools classes vary depending the faculty member you are with. Online games made by the teachers related with the actual topic makes the topic easy by practicing in the game, also entertain them at the same time keeping their minds relaxed and widely open to process more information within the game. Other teachers prefer individual activities with certain amount of exercises provided in previous classes. Those improvements help to find new ways to solve a problem, hints, and interpretation of the problems. The online courses does not provide incentives for students allowing them to decrease the interest in the process.

Finally, friends. They provide self confidence by asking an unclear problem and having different points of view at the same time. The opinions provided for the people you know encourage them to keep it up; there's some times the teacher explanations does not clarify at all and your group provides detailed explanations of a process. The efficiency in the group is enforced by dividing the labor and finishing soon; them the work can be shared with the people at the table, explaining how the process was made, and at the same time they can make corrections in what the other person have done. Different than the online practice made by the person self can take weight longer to get an specific difficulty.

Those are the reasons why many people prefer the schools rather than house. The help in questions by the teachers, improvement in learning in different ways, and the support of people you know and you feel confident with. Those reasons allow students to be better at something they aren't with the help of someone that knows more about the course.

Sometimes the people who has good skills or positive attitude in their jobs or any other occupations they have the opportunity to earn a higher position in their job. For example,all managers have that position because they have showed that they can have a good attitude with themselves and other people. This gives them the chance to be a successful person in life and help to become as them.

Education is also a big influence and how a person can have a good attitude and good values. Life teaches people how to control their emotions and help those who need it. In life to become successful people needs to have a goal and a plan how they are going to accomplish that. I know sometimes we have many problems and we think it not possible to have a good attitude but, there is a way how to deal with bad attitude and always have in mind the goal we want to accomplish one day.

There is always people who is going to say negative things to others instead of give them advises. Also many people think they can not do it after they try the first time and did not happened how they expected. People has to keep in mind that not always everything will be easy to get and there will be obstacles in life that will make you feel that you can not get what you want. By thinking and having a positive attitude people can make it become true just don not give until you have reached your goal.

In conclusion,in my opinion having a positive attitude can make people become successful in life. Be some educated persons and listen to what others say to them. Many older people or family might not want to see you fail and that is the reason for those who keep a positive attitude so they will be proud of those who protrude in life. Giving up would never be option for those who really have the desire to accomplish what they want. It is not going to be easy to always have a positive mind but,if the person really wants that then it will give all it's effort.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,1

3765,FA078892658B,"It is true that keeping teenagers out of trouble is important for many reasons. If regulations that require teenagers to be off the streets after 10 pm are adopted then they will help teenagers academically, socially, medically and economically.

The first reasons that proves that these curfews will help teenagers and keep them out of trouble is that if teenagers are not allowed to be on the streets in the middle of the night , then they will get more sleep and will learn more efficiently when they are school. For example, if a teenager is not allowed to be on the street during the middle of the night, then that individual will get a good night of sleep and will be able to stay awake during classes. Also, if this regulations are are adopted, then they will require teenagers to stay at home longer, which will help them because they will have more time to work on their homework and if they do their homework then they will improve their grades. Furthermore, these curfews will help teenagers improve their learning skills and will also help them rest more and get their grades up.

The second reason that shows why these curfews must be adopted is the one that will allow teenagers to socialize better. For example, if teenagers are in the streets in the middle of the night, then people will not want to be close to them because they might think that they are bad people and that they are probably involved in gangs, so they will be scared of them. Many people will agree that it is better if teenagers stay at their houses during night hours because if they stay at their homes doing good things, then they will make more friend, socialize and communicate better with people because no one will be afraid of them and no one will think that they are involved in some criminal group. So, if teenagers keep themselves out of the street during the night, then they will be able to make friends, communicate better and basically socialize in a better way in which no one will try to avoid them.

The third reason that proves that these curfews must be adopted is the medical reason. If teenagers are in the streets during the night, then they have the possibility of getting in fight and ending up with injuries. For example if a teenager is out during late night hours, then others might think that he or she is there because he's a bad person and then they might get into a fight in which someone could get hurt and end up in the hospital. These curfews will prevent teenagers from getting into fights and from having to go to the hospital when they can just stay at home and be safe.

The last reason that will keep teenagers out of trouble and will help them is the economic reason. For example, if a teenager wants to be out in the middle of the night, then that individual can find himself or herself a job that will allow him or her to work during night hours, keep him or her out of the streets and help him or her economically. Economically means that the person will be working, earning money and also staying out of his or her house during late night hours. Teenagers can improve themselves economically if they spend their time working instead of spending it in the street doing things that will not help them in anyway. Finally, by working and improving their economy teenagers will be able to save some money for their own future and have money available for emergencies that can occur throughout their lives.

Furthermore, it is better that these curfews are adopted for the security of teenagers. Also because these regulations will help teens improve themselves economically by keeping them out of the streets and motivating them to find a job if they want to be out of their house during late night hours, they will also help them socially because people will not be avoiding them if they are not seen in the street, medically because they will prevent them from getting into fights and having to go to the hospital and finally academically because teenagers will not be wasting time on the streets and they will have more time to do their homework and improve their grades at school.

2364,AF9F53EC3673,"Everyone has a talent or skill. In my case, Its music. Although my music skills are still improving, I would still consider it a talent or skill.

I've learned to play different instruments such as: the guitar, percussion, xylophone, and the violin, which is what i'm currently playing. At first I joined chorus in 1st grade and finished in 5th grade. I really enjoyed it ,so I chose to learn an instrument, which ended with me joining band. In band, I learned how to play the recorder. I played it from 2nd grade to 3rd grade. After learning the recorder I switch instruments to a xylophone, that played during 4th grade.

Since I didnt really like playing the xylophone, I chose to do percussion for 5th grade. I was also learning the guitar during 4th grade through 5th. when I entered middle school I decided to turn things around by choosing to do orchestra. I learned everything I had to know in 6th grade ,so I was ready to play the violin in 7th grade. I really felt passionate about the violin so I kept playing ,and still am ,and yet will continue until high school.

My music skills can be useful at times, for example: my parents once asked me to play a song for their wedding, they thought it was marvelous. Last year, I sang a song ,that I composed, for my sisters' birthday. She really enjoyed it. I like participating in music contests, concerts, etc. This year I went to New York for a violin concert, it was amazing.

First, putting more effort can help you grow of what you are good at. For example, i'm good at singing at church. I will put more effort so i can become better at my pitch and the tone of my voice. Putting effort on something means you want to be better at it, and also means that you will like to learn more and grow. Putting more effort can get you somewhere. What i mean by that is a better situation, a better position. There is nothing bad putting a little effort on something that you can get better at and achieve.

Also , You can always be better. Being better is better then good, for example, I am good at cooking, but i can be better at cooking. You can be better then someone ; become better than that person that you want to challenge, or you can challenge yourself. Challenge yourself is a good way to grow. Perfect takes practice; be good of right now, but become better in the future. Taking your time and taking it slow, you can 100% be better. Trust me its not easy to be better that you have already mastered, but there's always way and a chance.

The important thing you need to know is you cant not stop growing; you can always keep on growing even though you are already good at it. Only because you are already good at something doesnt mean you stop growing, you can keep growing, if you try a little harder. I will always try my hardest to be the best at it; no matter how hard it is. There is always a way to keep on growing. If you show others that you can be way better even though you already good so far, they will see that there is a way to keep on growing. Show an example to others; let other people know that it is possible to be better, at something you are good at. Prove to those people that thinks you cant keep on growing of what you already mastered. You will not grow, if you dont put more effort in it, and time. If you just stop of what your good at, then you will not grow.

Remember you can always grow of what you mastered. Dont let anyone tell you that you cant. practice comes perfect. Do all the things you need to do to be better, then you will grow more then you expect. Its never to late to keep on growing.",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,2

Many people believe that having a healthier school menu is a good idea because it lets students become healthy. The cafeteria should not change their lunch menu to a healthier school menu. It effects the students learning if they are not happy with their food, their parents pay for students school lunch, also students won't be used to the new healthier menu.

Students learning would be effected if they are not happy with their food. Students need food that they enjoy to motivate themselves. Students can't learn if they aren't treated with right food. If the cafeteria is not serving good menus, students will have a bad mood. It is important to give and treat students good food so that they will like being at school.

Parents aren't just paying their kid's school for nothing. Parents are paying for their child's school lunch to make them enjoy themselves at school and to learn. Students will be social if they are having a good meal at lunch. Students will also be active if they are getting the right food. Therefore it is important that the school needs to think about the students health.

Students would not be used to the new healthier menu, they would hate it. They will bring their own lunch because students don't like eating the school meals. It will also make parents stop paying for their child's school lunch. When most of students aren't eating the school food, other students will follow their footsteps. Moreover it is important to not change the school's menu because they won't get used to it.

A new healthier menu will effect students learning in school, they would not get used to the menu, and parents won't be paying the school for their child's lunch. Students will bring their own lunch to school. Students will not be active and social in school. Essentially it is very important that the school should stick with the same menu at all means. Changing students health is very important and you would need permission from all student parents to agree.

1491,73234AB62383,"Would you wanna be extending 2 more hour to your school schedule because you work for four days for 10 hours? In my opinion I feel like no because sometimes some students decide they want to spend some time with their family . Also some students have to go home early and do something else instead of doing their school work and some students have to enjoy their free time instead of working all day.

Some students decide they want to spend sometime with their family. Some students decide that because sometimes they might not have enough time with some one that lives far from them so they decide they want to go where they live and they want to be with them before they leave. Also some students might want to spend more time with there grandparents because they might not be able to see them or they either want to spend more time with there grandparents because they want to help them out side there in the stages of being old so they might need help with something. Also some students might want to hang out with their cousins since they might not have seen them for awhile. Student usually like to spend a lot of time with there family since they might not have seen them for years so they decide they want to spend more time with them .

Some students have to go home early and they have to go do something else instead of doing their work from school. Instead of doing their school work some students have to go after school to go sports so they might not have time to stay in school for 10 hours because they might have to be going to their practice whens school finishes. Some students might have to go straight home because they might have to go babysit their little siblings since there parents are working. Some student might have to go home early because they might have to go straight to work or they might get in trouble if they don't go at the time they tell them they could get into trouble. Students usually have to go do something else instead of having to go do their school work all day.

Some students have to enjoy their free time instead of working all day. Instead of staying at school all day or at work all day students decide to go out and hang out with their friends. Some students might want to go out and go shopping .Some student decide to go out and spend some time with their parents since they don't have that much time .Also some student just want to enjoy the only time they are free to do something instead of being stuck at school all day or being stuck at work all day.

In my opinion I feel like we shouldn't add more hours to out school schedule because at this time we are still young and we want to enjoy the free time that we have before we get older because then we won't be having that much time left since we will mostly be in school still or might just be working all day. Also I feel like some people might just be getting tired of all the work they give us to the point were some students might just give up on there work. For example when I get out of school I usually have to go home and take care of my little sister because my mom can't .

I wouldn't like to be stuck in school for another two more hours because I would have to be leaving school late and if I had a four day work week I would not be able to do my school work at home , When I would get home from work I would be really tired and just decide to fall asleep.",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,2
3701,F78366DD5A31,"The decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their family because, students know how to mange their time, families would remind or help out, and teachers give students time to finish or study assignments.

As a senior in high school, I attend to many activities after school and still have plenty of time to complete assignments. I believe, that managing time is key on getting everything done on time. In the past, I have asked teachers on how I could mange my time and still have time to complete assignments. After having that conversation, I had improved my grades and also had time for activities. Thats why I think managing time is a good way to complete school work and finish any outside activities.

If my family were to see me go out a lot or come back late from any activity without completing my work, they would talk to me and find a way to help me out. After that, they would see my grades and check for any late assignments because, there is no family that would like for their son/daughter to have bad grades in school. Many students would not pay attention on their grades and go outside thinking that they have nothing due for any classes. Although, thats when families come in and remind their child that they have assignments to complete before they go outside. This is why families are good reminders and helpers on getting good grades.

Teachers in high school give students enough time to complete assignments or study during class. I tend to complete it during class because I like to go home and not worry about any school work. Overtime if a student does not finish their homework, teachers tend to say that they gave us time to complete it during class. However, I do not make that same mistake and finish my work during class, so that the teacher would not bother me. That is why taking advantage on finishing working during class, is a good why to have time for any outside activity.

Technology helps us to stay in touch with our friends and family. Through social media,we can share our daily routines,share our pictures or we can make new friends.

I can admit I've have been several of times, In my opinion distance learning is a wonderful idea. Students can move at their own pase , you can replay the lesson video as much as needed , and it will prevent you from failing a class.

School can be stressful expecially when you miss a day and you feel like your behind on everything. Then when the teacher explains it to you , If you don't understand you might not want to ask for him/her to repeat it again. This can be avoided by the power of distance learning you'll be able to have classes online so you can move at your own paste. You wouldn't have to worry about asking a staff or classmate what you missed. Also you can take notes and do your classwork whichever way it works best for you.

However some students are visual and independent learners they focus better when they work by themselves. Working in a group at times might not always be the best option. When reviewing for a test or quiz you can go back and reread ,study, and take notes on whatever you're struggling with. Those notes can be reviewed as much as you want. If you're a type of person that has to have things repeated to you multiple times this is a great opportunity for you.

Last but not least , Are you failing a class due to not having enough time to turn your work in? You would probably not have to worry about that anymore because you can do your work at anytime. In class you are given a time limit you have to turn in your assigment. When your doing it online yes im sure there is a due date but you're not told what time your suppose to start at. If your at sports practice or have any free time you can start working on it. In my opinion this will prevent you from failing a class because you can turn it in whenever your ready to.

To sum it up this is an amazing opportunity alot of students should be looking to attend. If your school is offering this to you I highly recommend it. It can keep you on track and motivate you to complete and turn your work in on time so you don't fall behind in class. You can move at your own paste without anyone rushing you. And lastly, you can replay and reread anything as you would like with no limits. This is a big help for students who want to reach their goal of earning a diploma.

To begin, setting our aim low, and achieving our mark is a greater danger than setting our aim high and falling short because there's no limits to what a human being can do and achieve. For example, Isaiah Thomas, he was one of the best basketball players in the NBA at Boston. He's very short, and everyone doubted him and said he's too short and can't make it. That didn't stop him from aiming high and achieving his goal and becoming of one the shortest people to make it to the NBA. This shows that no matter who the person is, they can accomplish a lot in life as long as they work hard. Clearly, everyone should always aim high and accomplish their goal to have a better life later on.

Furthermore, people should always aim high even if they fall short because failure gives motivation to achieve more and come back stronger. For instance, The Golden State Warriors lost the NBA finals in 2016. It was one of the worst finals ever for them. They lost very badly, but that didn't stop them from coming back the next year and winning the championship. This proves that it doesn't matter how bad failure can be, as long as they come back from it stronger. Obviously, no should be scared of failure and everyone should aim high and try to be the best at whatever they do.

Overall, the greater danger for most of people lies in not trying their hardest to be someone in life and aiming low to accomplish their goal because failure motivates the person to comeback stronger and have no limits. In conclusion, Aiming high will get anyone successful as long as they keep working hard and fear nothing.",4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.1,2
130,0A1482CD6163,"I agree that "" A problem is a chance for you to do your best."" (Duke Ellington) because I believe that this statement means that even if there is a problem there is a chance for you to improve next time.

One reason why I agree with this statement is because you can improve for next time. For example, let's say you are having difficulty with one of the subjects you're learning at school and you have an assignment due the next day. So you try your hardest on this assignment but when you turn it in the next day you score a low grade,and you go ask your teacher if you can make up that assignment but they say no. Now in this situation the student can learn for this and take this as a chance to improve for next time.

Another reason why I agree with this statement is because something unexpected might come out of that problem. One way is that let's say you are doing a group project for on of your classes and there's a few people in your group that aren't contributing to the group. So you decide to try your best to take the lead of this project and try to get everyone to express their ideas. This shows how a group of student go through a problem with people not wanting to participate but then the student decides to take the lead of the project and try to include everyone.

My last reason why I agree with this statement is because you can do your best on something. One way you can improve the way other view you is by trying your best to solve that problem. For example, if you are having trouble with something then you can try to ask people you know are a teacher for help. This is so you can find the best solution to your problem and do your best.

In conclusion, I agree that "" A problem is a chance for you to do your best."" (Duke Ellington). Because there are many ways for you to learn from this statement,such as you can learn for you mistake and improve next time,something unexpected for that problem,and you can do your best on something.",4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.2,2
1774,863550AEB938,"I agree, they should adopt the 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew. Parents wouldn't be worrying all the time, kids would be focusing more on school, and curfew could teach kids how to be more responsible. Teenagers mostly want to go out and have fun with their friends. Teens are more outgoing when their around their friends. Teenagers might even be disrespectful to their parents if they don't let them go out. Teenagers should feel more grateful because of this curfew law.

Parents are mainly worried about where their children might be because nowadays there are so many things going on in society and we might not even know. That's why parents would feel like it's a great idea for the city council to put this new law. When parents let their children go out with their friends they usually tell them a time they may go and a time to come back. Most of the time kids don't even listen to their parents and they just come back at whatever time they want, but if they put this law parents wouldn't feel as worried as they usually do when they let their children go out. Kids would actually listen to what their parents are telling them and not just leave and come back at whatever time they want like if they didn't have parent's. Society now is really dangerous compared to back then because theres a lot of kidnapping, even killing teenagers. Now the fact that they brought this law parents might start to feel relived because they know that if their children are out on the streets after ten p. m. then they will get caught by the police and they'll have to face their actions.

If they put the 10 P.M. curfew law. Kids would go home early to their parents. Kids would go to sleep early. If teenagers would go to sleep early they would be getting a good night sleep and also they would probably not be falling asleep in class most of the time and actually paying attention in class. Teenagers sometimes think it's not important to learn like if it isn't important. Thats why they go out with their friends and forget theres even school the next day, but their wrong. We indeed need school to educate ourselves and so we can be a better person in the future. There are so many things teens can avoid so they can focus in their school and grades, but sometimes we make poor decisions by not listening to the adults.

Curfew teaches teens to be more responsible. They learn how to manage time and see if they can make it on time because if they don't. They know their going to get in trouble. Teenagers shouldn't be in the streets after 10 P.M. and if they are then its probably not something good their doing. Teens could avoid getting in trouble by the cops or anything by simply going home. Sometimes teenagers like to learn the hard way instead of the easy way. If they don't listen after they've been told a million times then they have to face their consequences. Teens should look at this new law as protection from not getting hurt or anything harmful.

In conclucion, If they choose the ten p. m. curfew hopefully teenagers start listening and respecting the time their parents want them home. Hopefully theres a change in teenagers learning in school, and on how responsible they are. Hopefully they know how to manage their time around their friends and not get in trouble. They should be more considerate about how much their parents worry about them every time they go out and anywhere they are at. At the end of the day this is only doing the best to help teenagers from being in any type of trouble. ",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,3.8,2
1288,62E5030D1A59,"Imagine getting a job that you're most interested and enjoys the most that later on life, you became super rich or making decent money but doesn't mind as long as you enjoy it and still continuing on. Life can be hard if people don't enjoys their jobs, causing them to have depression. That is why, students should select to visit and learn about the work that interests them because, it gives them more time to think, making plans for their future, and to gain experience through out the school years.

Students should be planning for their future and to decide which class to take in order for them to learn about the work that interests them. Many students have successfully acquired the jobs they intended to work because of how much work they put into to plan and learning the stuff they need to know on how to run the job. Planning is really important for all of our lives. For example, the military uses a plan and tactics in order for them to calculate and for the plan to be successful. Because of that, planning has a big impact in our lives and helps us to decide on what jobs to do and to give us the time to think. This way we can understand the situation and whether or not if the people and their families to decide if it's a good idea.

Students can gain little experience by taking the class every each year, this way students can learn more about the Jobs they want to be in. For example, JROTC are similar to military but trained to be a marching men and to juggle with rifle (from what I know of). They exist because, it helps students to understand what its like for them to experience JROTC. I also think this is very important. It's like, warming up for a swimming contest but, how can you win if you don't know how to swim? Swimming class exist to help people to not drown. If you take swimming class every year, and gain a little bit of experience, you will be able to win the swimming contest. All this reason is to proof of why gaining experience is a good thing and help you understand the job you wanted to applied for.

Giving students the time to think on what jobs their most interested on is also very important for this prompt. For example, students need time to think whether or not if it's the right class for them. Every year in high school students are required to pick three choice to pick their class. It is called the Course Election, where students gets to pick three class that are interesting for them or forced to pick because it is a requirement. I really like this idea, it helps us understand what we're interested on and what to learn. I think three years is enough for students to plan and to have a little experience for their future.

In conclusion, student are more successful if they are to be picked for themselves instead of the school choosing for them, because the more they like the class and the job they are going for, the harder they will try to succeed.",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.8,2

Technology has had impacted us negative wise and positive wise. For a lot of people they see technology as a huge positive impact for people.

People may think now that technology is out people contact other people way less but high chance that's not the case. People that do things like gaming or just connection with others online make it way easier to meet other people. For example theres websites like Omegle where you just go on and get into a voice chat with a random person around the country or maybe in other countries. There's also many other websites or apps where you can contact random people or even friends and family. There's also gaming, for gamers you usually go into lobbies or servers with thousands of people which is also an easier to contact people. For example if you own a PC, a PlayStation, or even an Xbox there's many games where you can contact people if you're making new friends or even just playing with them for as long until someone gets off. I have heard many stories where people have met online and grew a friendship even though they've never met in person they probably have each other's social media and numbers.

Many people use technology to shop. Online shopping is an easier way of finding things you need or even things you want. People commonly do online shopping only because it's just easier and quicker. Some people may have a busy schedule so it will make things easier if they're running errands or even just going out and spending time with family or friends without having to add something else to their list of plans. Online shopping is probably something everyone has done multiple times and many people can agree that it is easier and quicker than driving out to the store and searching through the whole store to find the things you want or need.

Once they try it at school and realize how much they like it there most likely going to eat healthier on a daily basis which is going to help there diet and help there body become bigger and stronger.

When kids go out to eat or are eating at home there going to have a better balance between when they should eat junk food and when they should eat healthy. When they eat dinner at home there going to have more on their plate than just the main dish there going to have vegetables fruits everything because they've tried that fruit or vegetable before and they know they like it.

However, some say school shouldn't offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home because students wouldn't get enough knowledge at home, it's better in school.

Actually, students should be able to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. First, Online is useful in many ways. Students can research the information, or students can watch video on YouTube. For example, Math, some students don't understand how to solve the equations, but they can watch the video and find more math learning. Also, English essays. last year, my English teacher told me to write an essay about the night by Eli Wisely. I researched him because I didn't know who he was at first, and I found his history in the holocaust, I read it. It was very tragedy. So, I wrote it down for project, and I found a lot information in the holocaust. It was useful finding information on Google.

Second, video conferencing is helpful. There is a website called Edubirdie. This website is use for teachers communicating with students for education. Students can spend time with teacher like 24 hours or depends on what time students chooses. Edubirdie helps students with essays, math problems, social studies, science, etc.. Also, I remembered when I had a final exam for chemistry, and the problem was I didn't learned anything from chemistry class. Because my teacher was horrible, I didn't learned anything from him. So, I searched to Edubirdie website and watched some videos of stochiometry problem and word problems. Then, I face timed a Chemistry teacher from Edubirdie. I spend like 10 hours with her. It helped me little bit. After that, I took the final exam and I barely passed the class with the D+. at least I passed the class and I'm happy with it.

1387,6B20E9C115AF,"I believe that a possitive actitude has a good impression in othre persons. But there around you are person who can influence you to be a bad attitude peson with others. The decison you make to be who you are is to realize that other person will act the same way to you as you just did to them.

Everyone need to be respected don't matter the age, country or religion becuase we all are humans. Been in a poaitive attitude will appeal the attraction of other persons to you by that will hepl you to success. Because if someone is being rude to them and you act different and start helping them they will notice that you have a good attitude to others that you dont even know. By the way you cannot judge someone just for their apparience is like judging a book with out reading it, it can be someone who will look with an angry face, a sad face even it can look weird but if you dont start sharing time, knowing each other, know what they like and what they do or how they are you cannot put your bad attitude just for how they look, they can also treat you as the same you did to them

However, people cannot recieve a bad attitude from you as if they were different to you. I think that we all are same with some differences than others as religion, country, color, etc... . I feel that recieving a bad attitude from a person that you even know is the badest thing that someone can do to you becuase you don't know that person and if you show that reaction from you that means that you're like that with everyone and show that you dont have respect to others. Even in your job is when you need to be the more kind as possible to keep those person that you don't know with you becuase as they need you, you also need them at the same time becuase they will help you to keep that job that you need, also your impression to them has to be best, as you show them at work you also need to show the best of you out of work that will show that you're successeful person in life and that you dont act good just when you need it and that is how you are and they can also trust in you because you are being honest to them.

Considerating that don't matter what you cannot give a bad treat to other person just because you woke up in a bad mood. I believe that if you are in bad mood and think that everthing is going to bother you is better for you to figured it out as soon as posible on you own, because people can not be involved with your own personal problem and i think even if you are not felling well you also need to be in a good attitude to the people because if you let you bad attitude to ruin the days of other they will think that you're always like that and will be enough to them to think the worse of you. However knowing that you don feel well and you gave the best of you to others before, that will be a great acomplishment for you and from now on you will be and example and will help othres that feel the same as you to continue and leave that bad mood behing and show the best of them.

In conclusion a good attitude is one of the important things to success in life. I think that every person have the right to be respected not for what they have is just we all need respect. People cannot be treat it bad because of you mood or just because you didn't like how that person is. Doesn't matter what you can't act bad with other persons, even if you don't know them and think that you will not see them again but the reality is that in other day you can really need from that person but that person will not be there for you because of how you acted before.

Schools should often do it and will affect these students careers. Kids have these types of dreams that they want to do and learn to get into. They often have the right to ask anybody why these things will help students have a good career and a college degree. The main reason is that this can help kids so much and tell their parents what they learn.

The reason why schools should allow to do this so that kids can go to college and when they are done they can do the job forever and they get the emotion inside of them. Learning so much is the only thing that should help students in school to get all the information inside of their head so that can get them where they want to be. Some don't really have a good thing what they want to do when they are trying to think what they want to do in their life, but it can be a hard choice to decide. Things can really get so good when ever we decide what we tell our parents what we want to do for our lives and other people's too. What we think is that when we go out in the world and see what we think about or something that shocks you when you get so surprised about it and you get it in you head and thats what you want to do.

The job that kids want to do when ever they grow up is the only thing they want to do or something else that's more better than the other one. Things can often have many reasons why kids should get jobs and buy their own things so parents don't have waste any more of their money on them. It's a good thing that parents should make kids work for a job to get money and save up to go to college and have a good time. The thing is that schools have the right idea to teach kids what they should and what they should learn about. This is why it's the right idea to make schools teach students other things that they should.

He is really excited to find a career throughout high school and knowing which one would suit him best. Unfortunately after he told his parents, they were not amused with his response. Generic_Name was sad that his parents didn't encourage him and wasn't as excited to find a career as he was before. Although some people think that it is ridiculous for students to identify a career at a young age, they are wrong. Students with benefit in knowing to identify a career because this will improve their knowledge, learn new skills, and teaches them how to make their own decisions.

Students will be able to improve their knowledge whenever starting high school because this will get students to be prepared for any task at any time. Students are also going to be noticing that there are more opportunities throughout the school and have the option to choose what suits them best. Students can be able to notice that high school many students really improve from freshman year to senior year and can compare how much they really care about the students education. For example, Generic_Name is a sophomore and is looking at a career to become an English teacher, but he hasn't really improved as much in his English class. He talked to his English teacher about it and wanted to get tutored and really know how to become a teacher. In less than two months, Generic_Name has improved so much in English and is finally understanding what to do and feeling confident that in the future he will become a teacher. Students will also benefit at finding a specific career if they learn new skills.

Students will be able to learn so much throughout high school and especially learn new skills. Many students whenever they start high school they can learn new skills, for example: playing an instrument, playing a sport, or even learning how to cook. Students will also learn new basic skills, weather its Math, Science, or History. Students can also learn new skills if they could join a club or activities throughout the school. Students will have the opportunity to learn all of these skills and could really help them out to find a specific career. For example, Generic_Name is a senior and wants to find a career about becoming a guitarist, but his teachers were concern due to how magnificent he is with Technology and Science. Generic_Name wasn't really interested in those careers and has told his teachers that he wants to play for the world. The teachers we're upset with Generic_Name but understood that he made his decision and we're still happy and proud of him. Generic_Name was glad he finally found the perfect career for him and was very happy with it. Students will have the chance to make their own decisions in high school.

High school really wants students to make decisions and teach them that they are becoming young adults and need to understand that they can also make decision on their own. Students will be able to have the decision to go for a standard diploma or an advanced diploma. Students also have the opportunity on weather to choose to go to the army or work whenever they finish high school. Another decision students will get is what career will suit best for them. Teachers really help out students with finding the right and best career for students. For example, Generic_Name is a freshman and really wants to graduate with an advanced diploma. She is doing really well in all her classes and teachers are recommending her many careers. Generic_Name decides to go to see her counselor about which career would she enjoy best. Her counselor tells her that it is her decision on what does she really like to do and recommends her great careers. Generic_Name really struggles on what to choose but will sooner or later realize what she wants to do.

Students will be able to achieve more intelligence, learn more tasks, and open new opportunities for students to know how to identify a career. Generic_Name started high school and isn't too happy about it. He is doing decent in his classes but isn't feeling confident about finding a career, but one day whenever he got home his parents decided to find him careers and told him that they have all their support and will encourage him no matter what. Generic_Name is filled with joy and encouragement that he started to improve in his classes and is starting to find a career that knew that he would love and enjoy.

3903,FFA6690BC309,"Having activities after school are good ideas for students so they would spend the time doing good things and not thinking in make bad decisions and we do not need more bad people in this world we need more good people to succes in this world. Although some people think that schools should control the students involvement in extracurricular activities nevertheless, the students should decide if the student wants to do extra activities after school because students would have the freedom to decide and some students needs that time to study or to work.

First, students need to have the freedom to decide if they want to do actives after school for example some students work after school sometimes they need that time to make money to help their parents to pay bills like rent or water. If the students have activities after school they would not be able to help their parents. Also some students need to take care of their family members like their brothers, sister or cousins. If the students do not help to take care of their family members their parents would have to pay somebody else and that would mean spend more money for them. The students who work are also learning more skills so in the future they would not be lazy and they are learning how an adult life is that is not to easy but they would be lucky because they would have learned that when they were younger. Also sometimes parents decide for the students to do an activity that they not even like which it means that the students would not be happy and they would have a lot of stress is better that if they want to do an activities they should decide what they want to do not be a parents decision.

Second, students need this time after school to do homework or to study. For example if the students have activities after school they would be late at home and they would be tired which it means that they would not study or do their homework so they would get bad grades and if they try to do their schools homework they would stay up late which it means that they would not get enough of sleep so they would be sleeping and lazy at class the next day. Also students need this time to take a break from the school and relax students school's life if hard sometimes they need a break from everything to came back with more energies. Having enough time to study would help the students to improve their skills at school so in the future they would have more opportunities to find a good job that they would enjoy and they make money to have a decent life and support when they have a family.

This shows that students should decide if they want to do extra activities after school because students can have the freedom to decide and the if the students have activities after school they would not have time to study or to do their homework. In my conclusion the life of a student is not easy they need to know how to manage their time so they can go to work or study sometimes they also have things to do at their house taking care of their family members. Students needs to choose if they have extra energy to do activities after school. Students would have a lot of time in the summer vacations so they can decide if they want to do and activities they would know how to manage their time to work and take care of their families member but they would be also enjoying their time doing activities.

Because if we're always doing something then we would succeed more in life, we would always be active and doing something productive. But it also depends on what kind of activities your doing and if what your doing is going to benefit you later on in the future. Because if what your doing isn't benefiting your future then there's no point of doing something that doesn't help you out for later on in life.

For example sports, if your always doing sports then that would be great way to benefit your future and also a good way to stay active. The reason I say this is because by playing sports you could have many different opportunities. Like getting scholarships into different universities, especially if you're great at playing the sport. And also it's another way to help you stay fit because your always doing some type of exercise in any kind of sport. So that brings me to my next example.

Another example is exercising, if you like exercising, going to the gym and just being active in general then that's another great thing to do that'll help you accomplish and benefit your future. Why I say this is because by being active it's going to help you to always stay fit and healthy. And how that benefits you in the future is because whenever you get older you won't have that many health problems or issues with your body so you'll always stay fit. What'll also help out a lot is by always eating healthy so that's something else you could do to help you accomplish and benefit your future.

Also working is something you could always do that'll help you accomplish more in life. Why I say this is because if your always working then that means you'll always have money. And having money would help you out in a lot of things. For example, it could help you out in school, for a car, food, clothes, and etc. Or you could also save up money for whenever you might need it for an emergency. It'll also benefit you by always having something to do so that way you won't just be home doing anything.

So in conclusion, doing something is always going to help us accomplish more in life. I don't believe inactivity serves a purpose because you won't accomplish anything if your not doing something that benefits you. You always have to be active and doing something productive if not you won't be successful in life. That is why I say that you have to do something that benefits you so you could succeed in the future. So yes, we accomplish more if we are always doing something.",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.4,2

Having a serious face all the time can mean lots of things, say for example you're life is horrible, your ready to go fight someone or it can mean I hate everything around me, thats not what makes a good first impression and it makes it impossible to change that. People now days don't want to be friends with someone who is always mad and is ready to fight someone, and because of that particular time you had serious face it led to you not having a girlfriend or a friend that was going to be with you for the rest of your life. First impressions can be hard to change and its impossible because once you had that one chance you waste it all due to that one serious face that everyone was intimidated and now people don't want to talk to you because all it would've took was a smile.

Then,not taking care of yourself can make people not wanting to talk to you. Hygine can can change everything and lets people know about who you are and it makes people wanting to talk to you.

Hygine is really important if you want to impress because otherwise it would make a bad impressions leading you not having friends or a girlfriend because no one wants to be around a person who smell bad and doesn't take care of themselves. The smilling comes in quick too, because you have a friendly convertion with people around you and people wnat to be your friends and it may not be because you don't smile. Your breath also counts becasue people like to have a conversation without having to smell what you ate for dinner or what you had for lunch, so is important to saty up with all those things beause people take notice of all those small things and the see that is woth talking to you.

Therefore having the proper clothes for the proper time can change the way people look at you and it can make you have friends and be known for dressing good and people now days want friends who dress up good, for example is the homocoming dance and you go with your friends and you're wearing jeans and shirt and you have your friend all dress up for the occasion and theres you now no one wants to take a picture with you or dance with, dressing the proper way can make a difference on how people see you and is somehting that is a proven fact. When my satrted working as a chef people in the streets would see that her clothes would be all dirty with food stains it would make people think that they don't know how to cook and what is funny that she was making lots of money making food for important people and people was thinking of a different way when she was making more money than the people judging her, but when she started working as a nurse people would respect her for the way she was dress, eventhought she was not making the same amout of money, but people people saw her differently. Those all cahnges that you make in your clothes can make a difference and they don't have to be expensive of from a popular brand because all it is clothes is just how you use them and what makes it good that the clothes can be cheap but how you use them for the proper ocassion can make a difference.

In conclusion having a serious face,not taking care of yourself and the way you dress up can make people have diffent thoughts of you. When being approche or even if they don't talk to you they will see that your not worth talking to and after they know who you are and your way of life style can make people hard to change that first impression of you. All this small things can chenge your life because I have been through those situatioins where people look at you differently and it makes it hard to change someones thought of you and that first impression that is important. Having a diffent mentality can change everything and peoples way of thinking.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.8,2

Attending classes at school will get the students to learn more subjects than online classes. If students does not attend classes at school there would not be teachers and staffs at the school.

Attending classes at school will get the students to learn more of other subjects. If a student takes classes at home they would not be focusing on their assignment. They going to be on their phone, TV, or other type of devices. There will be no one supervising the students at home. They need teachers to teach them, educate them, and motivate them to learn. Attending classes at school as you can see will benefit the student..

In addition, If the students does not attend classes at school there would not be no teachers and staffs at the school. Many jobs will be lost due to students taking classes online. Plus, the students needs to build a relationship with the teacher and staffs. Online classes would not teach a student face to face, It would be better If a teacher teaches the student face to face. As a result, there should be teachers and staff at the school, If the student takes classes at the school. Plus, the students will get a better education.

Many people may argue that students should take classes online instead of going to school. People think that online classes will give the student benefits. They also think that the benefit of taking online classes, is to give the students more opportunity to learn. In the other hand, they are people who also believe that taking classes in school is better. Schools are meant for students to learn on other subjects. If a student takes classes in school they will have the opportunity to learn much better.

Therefore, students should take classes in school. Schools are meant to be for students to learn from all subjects. Taking classes in school would benefit the students. If the students take classes in school, there will be more teachers and staff at the school.

If the teacher wants to do an phone activate the students can use their phone to do that activate. The Students will be more active on their work if they had their cell phones with them in school.

In a math class the students can use their phones as caculators for educational purpose in case their actual caculator ran out of batteries.

When people want an advice they ask more than 1 person because they want to hear different advice to make sure they don't make mistakes, and they want to hear the right an advice.

I think people should ask for an advice to more than one person, because maybe the first person that they ask for an advice were wrong. For example, when I need an advice I always ask my parents first. I always ask both of them, but sometimes they always have different opinions, parents always have the right advice for you, but the problem is the sometimes they both give you a different advice. Sometimes they told you an advice that you might not like, or the one that you weren't not looking for, and thats when I ask other people about advice like my teachers, friends, brothers, cousins, principals. just to hear what you wanted to hear or the right decision.

Without a doubt, I would ask more than one person for and advice, to hear about others people situations. clearly, I would ask multiple people an advice because you never know who's wrong or who's right, but atleast people give you different opinios, so they're giving you ideas about what you can't or can do. On the other hand if you ask only one person for an advice that person might be wrong, and you might to a wrong decison.

People should listen to all the advice that people give to them. I always listen to all the advice even if they're wrong i just need to make sure not to make the wrong decision. Sometimes I make mistakes by not listen to the right people.

People ask more than one person because when the first person that you ask and they told you something different, what you really wanted to hear. For example, I personally like to ask my parents for an advice first, but sometimes I don't like what they say to me, so thats when I ask other people like my friends, sometimes you think your friends are right not your parents. But let me tell you something parents are always right it doesn't matter if you don' like them or whatever but they're always right they will never will give you the wrong advice.

I can make the right or wrong decisions because i'm a human and everone had make wrong decision in their life. But sometimes people give you the wrong decision.

2829,CE214B0C2CB6,"The British naturalist and politician John Lubbock once wrote, ""Your character will be what yourself choose to make it

In my opinion, we do choose who we want to be. I agree with John Lubbock because not everyone has the same intentions as the people who surround us, we choose our own path, and people are raised differently.

Not everyone has the same intentions as the people they hang out with. Not because I want to go to college and become a nurse, means that my best friend, that I spend most of the time with, would want to be a nurse or be in a medical field as me. Some people might think differently and say that we are influenced by the people we spend our time with. We choose who we want to become. People have their own dreams and choose their own path.

We choose our own paths. I once got invited to a party where I knew there were going to be lots of teens drinking and doing drugs, so I told my friend, who invited me, that I didnt wanted to go because I new it was bad. For some people it is just fun and dont think about the consequences. Not everyone thinks the same, and people are raised differently.

We were all raised differently. For siblings, I think it is different because they are being raised by the same people and have almost the same points of view, but that does not mean they are or think the same. There could be two sisters being raised the same but one might have different habits or opinions than the other. At the end of the day we choose who we want to be.

We choose who we want to be. Yes, we are influenced by the people we see everyday and we might just take it as inspiration, but we are the ones who work towards our goals and not anyone else.

3373,E8B0698217A3,"They say the you should never judge a book by its cover and, especially regarding people, its true. In this case, the cover is not necessary meaning the appearance, but the first impression of another person. Like the cover of a book, first impressions are not always as appealing as what is really there. its not until after you start ""reading"" or get to know someone, when you really find out that what you see is not always what you get. There are several factors that can affect the first impression that one receives from another. Differing personality, situations and representation of a person, make impressions often the worst means of judging people.

A person's personality has a big effect on the first impressions that they emit. Everybody is different but when it comes down to it first impressions are really based off of whether you are shy or not. I met my best friend after moving during my junior year, at my new high school. Before i knew her, she never said a word to me or anyone else in the classes that she was kind of odd, but then realized that I was the same way, i didn't talk to many people either because of my personality. I knew that I was shy person and after I get to know someone, I put down my front and show my true colors. I thought that maybe she would be same way. After starting to talk to her a little more each day, our friendship grew and I learned that she wasn't odd at all, but just like me an outgoing person hidden by their shyness. Some people like me and my friend, are shy and put up a reserved and quiet front when facing new people. Based on my first impressions of my friend, I thought something that was far from the truth. One who has a shy personality might in reality be outgoing, but uncomfortable showing it at first, making the first impression of that person a mistaken one.

Your first impression of someone is not suitable because you do not know the situation they may be in. When seeing or meeting someone new, you have no idea the kind of day,

difficulties or kind of disappointment that person may be experiencing. They may have have recently lost someone, or could be someone new and yet still have to deal with the routines and stresses going through out their day. All of these situations can create a barrier between themselves and others, and setting of a good impression is probably not at the top of their list of important things to do.

On my first day of senior year, I walked hurriedly to my first class, even thought I had plenty of time to get there. When I walked into my class, the only thing on my mind was to find a seat right away, no matter if it was by another person or not. when the time come to eat lunch, I sat by myself and ate it quickly so I could proceed to my next class. I was so worried about being late for a class, finding a seat and just doing things right, that i didn't have time to try to leave any good first impression, on any of my peers. It wasnt even on my mind to do so. My peers received the impression that i was nervous and not a sociable person, when really I was acting the way I was because of the situation that I was in.

There are many factors that lead to someone's first impression of another. Someone;s personality, current situation, or the way they happen to present themselves all influences the way someone thinks about another when seeing or meeting them for the first time. Since what they think is based off of these judgments, their first impressions is usually wrong. If all friendships were based on first impressions, there would be a lot less of them in the world. First impressions are more often worst means of judging a person because its not until you get to really know a person, you are better equipped to understand what kind person they truly are, and really know the individual based on real values, rather than their first impression or ""book cover"".",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,3.5,3.9,2
460,22CFD6C961E3,"Some school districts allowing there students to graduate in 3 years instead of the traditional 4 year is something I strongly consider, and surely something I think we all also have to consider. Being able to graduate in 3 years not only gives you an extra year, but also gives you the proper amount of time to plan your future. The amount of time that you would be spending in school would be a year less.

Given a year, it is up to you, how you use it and what your going to do with it. Getting a job would help save you a lot of money for college. Having a year off doesnt exactly mean that you have to go to school, but instead getting a job will be very beneficial. Whether its to support your family, save money for school, or even for pocket money, knowing that you have not only time, but also extra money, will help you realize that there isnt much to stress about. Jobs also dont have to be something that is outside of school. Having a job that is academic wise or just something temporary to have the experience, will help open you up to more opportunities. Whether you are looking forward to go to college or to become more appealing to bigger organizations/ companies in your work force, having a job that is academic base will help. For example, going to coach my brothers soccer game during the weekends compared to going to a community center to fix computers during the weekends, wouldnt really open me up to more work opportunities rather than fixing computers at a community center will.

Going to college isnt for everyone, but for many is the way to go. Maybe your going for your Masters or even a PHD, when you have a year you are saving the amount of extra time that you would be spending in school. Lets say for my PHD I would have to stay in school for 8 years, knowing that I have saved my self a year even though it doesnt seem like much compared to 8 years is not only saving time and money, but also saving a year to your age. Most student that go for the traditional 4 years typically are being rushed and become stressed out by the end. Colleges will also see that you have graduated showing them your were willing to work hard to get that extra year.

Being able to graduate in 3 years doesnt only ask for patients but also for your dedication. Although you are graduating a year early, it doesnt neccisarly mean that the work load given in that year doesnt have to concern you. You would have to be able to manage your time and work hard to makeup for that year, yes, even if it means you have to give your summer break. Staying organized and knowing what your aim is, will give you more confidence making you become dedicated.

Although some may argue that this is definitely something stressful and given 3 years is not enough for the workload in high-school, just know there is still hope. There are some student that dont have enough time to even finish in 4 years. So being thankful, you should know that it is alright if you cant finish in 3 years. Having this program gives opportunities to student but also saves time. School districts should label the students that have enough credits to graduate and for those that don't, and for those that dont, they should offer support (programs/ clubs) for them to possibly graduate in 3 years. If its not possible for students to graduate in 3 years then the 4th year should just be a less stressful year.",3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.6,2
2649,C41DFE052637,"Imagine someone is doing the same skill that he already has mastered, he is going to stay in the same place. He will never grow. One reason why doing different things can help someone grow is by being stronger in other things. Being able to learn new skills can improve your ability. Someone can even find out if they are good at other things that they probably never thought they would be good at. Is the best to try to do new things than staying in the same place and never growing.

First reason, why doing different things can help someone grow is by being stronger in other things. Being stronger in other things can really put you to the top where you never thought you could be at. When getting stronger at other things it could make someone the best athletic person or the best person that is strong in so many things. When being strong or good at things, you can even help your friends if they are struggling. Once you become a strong person are you going to be able to do anything.

Next, being able to learn new skills can improve your ability. Learning new skills can help someone out a lot. When doing a lot of new things it can make someone a healthier person. Someone is going to start realizing their improvement and once they start seeing results, they are going to start getting motivated even more. When someone knows so many skills, they could probably teach another person that wants to be like you. Is a great thing to be able to improve your ability.

Finally, someone can even find out if they are good at other things that they probably never thought they would be good at. Finding things that someone never knew they could do will make someone pretty shocked. When someone finds out more things that they are able to do, it can help them join in more activities. The people that can do more, they have a better advantage because they can do more that others can't do. Its pretty shocking that there are people that don't know that they could do something that they never thought they could do.

In conclusion, someone can make themselves even stronger than what they are now. When learning new skills it can make your ability improve. Also, someone can even find out new sports or skills that they never thought they could do. ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.5,3.7,2
1829,89C7C4115B84,"One place that i really want to go is Generic_City, Italy. i really want to go here mainly because of the stuff i can do their. I really want to see the fancy cars that Italy make's like the Lamborghini or the Ferrari an the Alpha Romero or other car that i normally dont see here were i live. I also want to know more about their culture. i wan to learn their language i want to eat their food i want to know how they live if ts ruff or easy or even both. I really want to eat the real Italian food! i always wanted to see if their would be a difference. One other main reason i want to come is for the tours, i want to get on the cannou then paddle and ride the whole channel.

The reason why i really wan to see the fancy cars is because i have a big thing for cars. Ever since i was a little kid my dad will always talk about cars and i'll always be with him ill play with toy cars and and when ever i see i nice car i always call it out saying ""thats my mustang gt"" or ""thats my supra"". My cousin always modifies if cars (he's also a car guy) he's another reason why i like cars. He has a Rx-7 every single part is modified he spend more money on his car then he does of him self. When i grow up i'm going to be a car guy like him. Another reason why i want to go to Italy to see the cars is because were i live you would see a Ferrari like once every 1-2 years and over in Italy seeing a Lamborghini must be like seeing a mustang. so that is why i want to see the luxury cars.

I really want to know how their culture is. i want to know how life is over their i want to see if their kind or mean. i want to learn their language so i can talk with them. To me learning their language or understand it will be an easy thing to do. I think it will be easy because Italian and Spanish language is closely the same. I just don't want to be in on part of the country i also want to go to other places because i know that their are different cultures around the country.

I mainly want to try the real Italian food i dont want to be eating the American version of Italian food. I want to see if their a difference of the the foods i want to know witch one tastes better or if they taste the same. thats what i want to know about their culture.

Another thing that i want to do over their is go in tours. i want to go on tours because when i see on the TV shows, movies, and commercials i always say ""im tryna go their!"". I also want to go to tours over their because i can see the cultures and how places look their. When i go on tour i find out stuff that i didn't know about and finding about new thing is good for your brain. I also always wanted to go to the cannel waters and ride. ever since i was a little kid i would see that people would ride on the cannel waters.

2500,BA0D3D6A8A94,"I disagree with this plan. I say this because the amount of hours we come to school everyday is enough. If the school board add another hour and a half to the school day all students will be tired, and the students would not be able to learn everything during the day. Being in school for a long period of time and getting homework would put a lot of pressure on the students. For most students the amount of time we come to school at the moment is already putting a lot of pressure. If the school board add another hour and a half most of the students will surely dislike school and maybe even drop out or show no interest in school work or homework. Students would also have a very short amount of time to study for tests or the big projects that they have to finish outside of school at home because some students have a part time job.

Students need some free time for their happiness and physical health. As a middle school student I can say that I get to have free time and do my school work just fine at the moment but with getting one hour and a half added to my school schedule I don't know if I would still have the time to have fun and do my school work and still manage time to spend with my family and friends. It would effect my health if I don't get enough free time to play with my friends or do the things I like. For those students who have a part time job won't be able to spend enough time with their family or friends or get some time to rest. It would surely effect their mental health, physical health and happiness because they are not going to get enough time to work out or do something fun to rest their mind.

Teachers with part time job would have a difficult time on teaching students their best and having a part time job. Mostly all teachers have a part time job because they have a big family and their income from teaching is not enough or they want to save money. All of them have their personal reasons for it. But teachers can not have a good part time job if the school board add another hour and a half to the school day Because teachers must stay after school at least once or twice a week to help the students that needs help or want to take a retake on a test. Teachers will not have enough time for a good part time job or to really take good care of their kids for the ones that are married. The ones that are not married to just take good care of their mom and dad. So teachers would either have to quit teaching or get their salaries increased. So they wouldn't need a part time job to earn more money and they would have time to take good care of their family.

Drivers already are taking a risk for driving in the morning when it's dark. It's very difficult for them to drive a school bus that's full of students when they can't really see the road. Adding one hour and a half is the last thing that the bus drivers need on their plate even if the school board adds one hour and a half to school day it's okay for the bus drivers. But what's not okay is the after school program. After school program is for two hours and with adding one hour and a half to the school day that's three hours and thirty minutes later than the normal time. It would be really dark. So it would be really hard for bus drivers to drive and it would be too risky. It would be dangerous for the bus drivers and all the students that is going to be in it.

After school is a program that helps every student make up missing work, retake a test or redo their homework to bring up your grades. It also help the school finish their work quick when students stay to help for their serves hours. But sadly the schools might have to shut down after school program if they add a hour and a half to school day because it would be hard for teachers, bus drivers and students. Students wouldn't stay after school because by the time the school finishes all the students would be really tired.",4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.1,2

You learn from peoples mistakes. If you learn from other peoples mistakes you could avoid them. I find it really helpful when I learn from others mistakes. Learning mistakes could help you in life to be sucssesful. My friends make a lot of mistakes which I learn from them. Most people do think making mistakes isn't a good thing, but I think it could help you improve on what you did wrong. What I'm saying is that learning mistakes frorm others is a good thing.

You learn what they went through. Learning what others went through could help you understand people more. Understanding people could help you understand people more. Another reason is that learning what they went through could help you a lot in the future. If you find someone like them, you could help them. You could get close to the person and know them better. getting to know someone could help you make a friend, which is something everyone needs. learning from other and what they went through could help you sometime in the future.

You could learn different ways on how they solved their problem. When you find out how they solved their problem, it could help you. You could be going through the same thing and might need help or advice. If someone else is going through it, you could help them or give advice. In my opinion, helping others is a big thing in life. You learn that most people could have the same struggle, and they solve it in different ways. I think it's a good thing to know that two people went through the same thing, and had different ways to solve it. In conclusion, you should learn how others deal with their problems.

788,3D4475C949C2,"The idea of schools allowing their students to take classes from home is is an excellent idea. Not all students learn the same way,or at the same pace as everyone else. Having the opportunity to learn in a way that is most comfortable for you, can really show improvements in grades. Students who are sick and are not able to attend school also have an advantage of doing missing work from home. This will give students no excuse for being behind with school work if their able to do classes from home.

Students that are often sick, or miss a lot of school because of personal reasons would have an advantage with doing their classes from home. If students have the opportunity to do classes from home they dont have to stress about returning to school, and having a lot of class work to make up. Therefore, students will no longer have an excuse for failing classes because of absences if they have the option to do it from home. When i had my surgery last school year it was nearly impossible for me to catch up on all my missing work, the only way i could do my class work was if someone picked it up from school. Unfortunately my parents both work so while i was out of school i had no way to do it from home. It was very difficult to finish all that work after getting back, because i was not given many options of getting the work done. If i was given the option to complete my class work from online this would have really helped me maintain my grades up.

Seniors might be in the position where they need more than the usual amount of classes to graduate by their final year. Having to be in such a difficult position and only being able to attend morning or night school can make it harder to get these classes done on time. This will only make it stressful, and discourage students to get the classes done by the time of graduation. Not only do some seniors have jobs after school but having to attend a full day of school, and either morning or night school can be tiring and overwhelming. Overdoing yourself can also decrease the amount of people that pass their classes because of the reason that they have to much to get done in a matter of one school year,so allowing students to do some classes online will make it easier for more students to graduate.

The idea of online classes might sound difficult for some students because they tend to learn better face to face. Schools can offer virtual teaching lessons for those who have an issue with attending all their classes at school and learn better by someone verbally explaining each concept to them. Not all students have computers at home which is understanding, in order for students to complete online classes from home they will need a computer,schools can offer students a borrowed computer or laptop in order for them to participate in online classes. Schools can Introduce a system where they provide for those who need the help of obtaining a computer and to still be able to do their classes from home. By providing for those who need the computers, students will not be held back from the idea of doing classes from home just because they dont own a computer.

Having the choice of doing classes from home can be very beneficial to students. This gives students the opportunity to complete more classes and actually do them without having the excuse of being absent to school. Given the chance of doing classes from home can increase the passing levels for more classes. The idea of doing classes from home can be helpful for students who need it, and encourage students who need the option of at home classes to actually get these classes done from home. I think all schools should have an option that allows students to do classes from home.        ",4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.1,2
2759,CA7CE4CE7ED3,"Has there been anyone in your life that shared any wisdom or experience with you? If not, why not ask someone that is important to you? They would love to share maybe a dad, mom ,grandparents they have tones of experience in the past. A person who has shared wisdom or experience with me would be my father ,because he has showed me how to be respectful to adults and show me how to work some business papers.

One thing that my father had shared with me is how to respect adults. For example, my father wasn't always the best child. He would do bad choices like going out with his friends all the time and not listen to this parents. But as he got older he realized no one though he was serious and rejected him. They thought he was trouble child, Soon when I was born ,and when i was able to talk and walk my. My father would make me say please and thank you. As well as listening to the adults, bow when entering a door and greeting them. My father did not want me to me like him when he was younger so he made sure I was respectful to my grandparents. This shows that my father gave me some experience to get respected into the family.

Another thing that my father has shared with me is how to work at a business. For instance for the past few months my father has showed me how to do paper work at his second job. My dad has to count the money that he was getting and how much to give back the workers. So a few times my dad would come into my room and teach me how to split the money they were making and pay the bills. Those days he showed me showed me how much money everything is ,and made me realized that I need to work very hard because if I want a simple job that I doesn't do much that gave a job that can pay my bills I need to work hard in school. This shows that my father really cares about my future and want me to do well in life and showed me some wisdom in of how hard like will be if i don't do well in school. In closing my father taught me how to do business and how to process one because I want to do business.

In conclusion a person who has showed me wisdom and experience would be my father by teaching me to respect adult and how to do paper work at his job. H+e had showed me by telling about his past and show how to mange a business when I am older. So what are some people that is important to you that has shared wisdom and experince?

Some people would go to France to see the popular Eiffel Tower; while others would go to Hawaii just to relax. For me however, I would like to visit Generic_City because the people there are well mannered and kind. And also because there are amazing waterfalls and parks.

To begin with, the people there are well mannered and kind because they treat each other like brothers and sisters instead of mortal enemies. And something I would like to do once I arrive, is to greet these grateful and thankful people because they are gentle to one another. Furthermore, most of the people in Dubai make a honest living and there is rarely any crimes caused by residents.

Additionally, there are amazing waterfalls and parks because the designs and structures are well made and created. For instance, when visiting the waterfalls at night, it is very colorful which makes it beautiful to watch. Also, something I would like to do when I arrive, is to go on a boat ride because it is very peaceful and it make you feel calm as the ride goes along.

In conclusion, a place in the world I would like to visit is Generic_City because the people there are well disciplined and nice. And Also because there are outstanding waterfalls and parks. ",4.0,5.0,4.5,4.5,5.0,4.0,4.4,2

You learn from your experiences because your action, words you use or say, and your appearance can show exactly who you are. People agree with this statement because you can change your appearance, words you used and your actions.

First of all, when you meet someone for the first time the way you act is important. Due to the fact that your actions speak louder than words is true. Your actions are things you can not change from your first impressions. When you start to act in front of somebody you just met, do not be mean or rude to them.

If you do that they will think you are not a good person to be around. You need to make sure you do not mess up the first time.

When you speak to someone you just met do not use bad words because if you do they will think you do not know how to talk to someone. When you talk ,you can use big words or just talk normal because no matter how many times you talk well to them you are gaining their trust. Make sure you do not mess up or stutter a lot I know you may stutter but you can always try your best not to stutter so much. If you mess up some people are nice enough to give you a second chance. Make sure you do not talk with your hands when you meet someone new.

In addition your appearance is the most important thing of first impressions. Your appearance is something you can not change. Your appearance is the way you look on the outside and inside . People always focus on people appearance the way you act and the words you say but mostly on your appearance. When you have a bad appearance they will think you are bad person and they will not want to be friends with you. If you have good appearance they might like to be friends with you, but it depends on their first impressions too.

If you like the way they act or the they talk or most of all their appearance. If their first impressions was good then you might want to be friends with them. Your first impressions are impossible to get out of your head and also impossible to change.

On the other hand you might be able to change people's minds. Some days you can have a bad day and other days you might have a good day. Some people appect that you are having a bad day and they know you are not like that. However, no matter what happens to you there is always a second chance at first impressions.

To sum up some people say that your first impressions are impossible to change and people agree with that. The important things are your actions, words, and your appearance. People will always learn from their own experiences. You need to always be careful of what you do, say and look like to someone. Clearly, you meet new people everyday.

We all have the right to do whatever we want and be whoever we are unless you want to hurt someone. We are free to do what is better for ourselves without being judge, so why do we let society control us?. People should not be afraid to be who they are and show the world what they are made of. All humans are different, we all come with different shapes, sizes, personalities, skills and that is what makes us beautiful, the power of being ourselves.

Experiences make you grow and morph you into a better person, life makes you realize how bold and smart humans are, in addition to this we all have been raised differently so trying to follow an exteriotype is like letting go the opportunity you have been given by life to find out what you are made of, to find oud your power, your way of doing things and solving problems, and last but not least you are letting go the opportunity to make up your own thoughts just because you are giving people the chance to control your mind and the way you think.

I totally agree with this statement, to be yourself in an environment that is constantly trying to make you something else is one of the best decisions you could make, perhaps just by being yourself you could teach someone else how to improve its personality, or maybe you could show them how to act when it comes to solve an issue, theres is multiple opportunities we miss just by trying to be someone else . All humans have a superpower within their selves that they could share with everyone, therefore, trying to fit in, follow an exteriotype and trying to act the same way the others do is equal to not take advantage of our power wisely.

We are afraid of showing who we are because, to us is more important what they would say and think about it. We care more about their reaction towards us and what we do not realize is that maybe they would like more who we actually are than the person that we are trying to be. Once humans face the truth and notice how valuable and special we are, that will mean that we have gotten the greatest accomplishment in life, which is being ourselves no matter what the others say or ask us to do.",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.9,2
3075,DACE7A4DE7DB,"I agree with this statement, because a positive attitude helps you cope more easily with the daily affairs of life. It brings optimism into your life, and makes it easier to avoid worries and negative thinking. If you adopt it as a way of your life, it would bring constructive changes into your life, and makes them happier, brighter and more succesful.

Whith a positive attitude you see the bring side of life, become optimistic and expect the best to happen. It is certainly a state of mind that is well worth developing.

Also a positive attitude leads to happiness and sucess and can change your whole life. If you look at the bright side of life, your whole life becomes filled with light. This light affects not only you and the way you look at the world, but it also affects your enviroment and the people around you.

If this attitude is strong enough, it becomes contagious. I'ts as if you radiate light around you.

When you are positive, you tend to pull yourself out of negative loop and don't lose focus from what you really want to achieve, the person with a positive attitude has a better perspective of life. understand that is important to take resposibility for one's actions for example: problems in your work, family, school etc. A strong sence of responsibility always envokes positive and constructive actions. A positive thinker is never impulsive, they always wait to get clarity of a particular situation.

Being positive and calm always enable you to see both sides of the coin.

Positive attitude is the key to sucess in lifen because if you are positive you will belive and trust yourself, and you won't let negative people affect your deams, if not you will work hard until you get them and go will sucessful.

3160,DE921CECE21A,"Do we accomplish more by constantly doing something? Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" He believed that more would be accomplished if there was something being done most of the time, I agree with this. Accomplishing a task motivates some people to do more, accomplishing more, It also helps us learn more about ourselves. Although, people believe that being in-active is better because it provides less stress and more free time, It also keeps us from succeeding our daily tasks and influences us to be lazy.

Being busy would require us to be awake and alert of what we are doing. In some cases, after finishing up a task, all people want to do is move on and rest. In other cases, people choose to knock out more work that they have in mind. Having this kind of mindset it good, because it allows a person to have more energy and to keep themselves busy. A personal experience would be when I was so tired one afternoon, but I had to keep myself from napping because I had homework due. After I completed that one homework, I was too awake to even sleep; So I decided to knock out other work I had in the meantime. In the end I received a better grade from that class and I had chores finished from that week so I didn't have to do anything in the weekend. To conclude this paragraph, when I accomplished one thing I ended up accomplishing more than I expected.

We all have our different ways of living and learning. One way to help you learn more about yourself is by keeping busy. You learn how to manage your own time, you learn about how you react to a hectic environment which can help for future references, and You learn how your own mind works. For example, When I was in my sister's sixteenth birthday party, I also had school to focus on, homework to get done, and Sol's to focus on. For me it was a pretty hectic schedule, but I learned how to respond and manage my time. Learning how to manage my time came in handy when my sixteenth birthday came along. Everyone has a different way of living and learning, and keeping myself busy taught me a lot about how I live and learn.

Although being in active provides us with less stress and more free time, which is not always a bad thing, It influences us to not only be more lazy, but to procrastinate. To procrastinate put off something that should be done, To leave it for that moment and do it later, as you repeatedly tell yourself, but you occasionally never end up doing it. Procrastination can lead you to become more and more unprepared. Being unprepared isn't the best way to live. Having more free time can have it's positive outcomes, but also its negatives. For example, who wants to accomplish nothing now, only to do the same in the future? People may believe being in-active is a better way to live because it relieves you from stress and work, but doing nothing can follow with other bad habits that can lead to worse in your future.

In conclusion, we accomplish more by keeping busy. Keeping ourselves busy can help us prepare for our future, and help us learn more about ourselves and how to respond to a hectic lifestyle. Although some people would like to live a lifestyle doing absolutely nothing, that wouldn't be the case for all. Others would prefer to accomplish more by staying active and helping themselves prepare for whatever comes next.                     ",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.9,2
1539,7658C61156C7,"According to the Generic_School, that believe that 70% high school students change their mind about what career they want to do after high school. I believe that high schools should never let students choose specific courses because, some of students don't even have in mind what they're trying to do after high school, another reason is that they're way too young to choose something that is going to affect your whole life, my last reason is that students may change their mind and choose another course and the school is not going to let them choose another course.

High school students change their mind all the time we may want to be a doctor today and tomorrow we want to be a barber or wanna go to the army, for example my best friend go to a school like that you have to choose some specific courses so when you get graduate you don't be confused about what you going do in college and he told me that he's trying go to a different school because that school doesn't let him change his courses because he was trying be a firefighter but now he change his mind and want to a doctor.

We high school students are way to young to choose some specific courses for our careers I believe they should make a conference and discuss all that with our parents.

My final reason is because students not really sure about what are we trying do in my opinion they should let us do that on the student's senior year because, on their senior year students have a clear mind set of what they going to do after students graduate, like my other friend that go to Generic_School now he's a senior and he's going to be doctor so the school just want him to take the nurse and biology class.

In conclusion, I believe that school should never let students choose their classes or courses, even though it would be nice if you want to be a doctor for example the school should force you to take doctor's relate classes so you can get use to do things that doctors does.",4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.6,2
2938,D36CCF111F86,"A positive attitude is more helpful to others and motivational,But ones attitude dose not necessarily have to be positive in order to succeed. Ones attitude can be either positive or negative as long as it improves ones ability to succeed. There are many keys to success but attitude is a major key , because attitude introduces or rather shows character. A positive attitude is a great thin but ones attitude can be negative ,but it is more over whelming to others and some might not either like or no longer associate with that person. As long as that attitude helps with your success it should not matter what type of attitude youve got.

Ones attitude is ones guide as it allows more options to come ones way. In a way attitude can guide and help ones path to success or it could close all the doors to ones dreams and success. On the side of a beneficial attitude; people can really catch the feeling of your attitude. What that means is if the attitude is negative but it gets things done then it should not matter as long as it benefits the amount of work or what ever is being or getting done. A positive attitude is more or rather feels more rewarding that much of a negative attitude. A positive attitude is more rewarding and dose allow the people getting that attitude to feel more successful and more appreciated.

Although a positive attitude is more beneficial it can lead into less work or less progess being made and shows that one is not trying hard enough to succeed. By having a negative attitude your showing to others that your work matters. And by doing so you can encourage others or rather inspire others have have a good work ethic by tring your hardeste even if some one is pushing you to work in a negative way. Success come to ones mind and it over comes everything if they put their minds to it.

Yes attitude is a key to success, but it dose not have to be positive if its beneficial to one in their path of success. I do believe that a positive attitude is more appreciated but a negative attitude is less appealing. I feel as long as your attitude is improving your work ethic and it benefits your progress then is should not matter wether or not its positive or negative as long as you have the right mind set you should have a successful work ethic. Your attitude reflect on your work it just depends on how you use your attitude in your work. for example if my boss came in yelling at me saying "" get to work your not getting paid for nothing."" thats a negative attitude so thats going to make me have a negative mind but if i can use that frustration and negativity to inspire e to do my work I will notice that all I have to do is do my work and my bosses attitude will change one me. But if my boss were to have a positive attitude then I could also use that as a motivation as it not only shows me that my boss likes that I do my work but it shows me that im appreciated.

I can see that having a positive attitude is more motivational, but ones attitude can be negative as long as it benefits you and others in a positive way. people need to understand that they can use these attitude to benefit themselves. Peoples attitudes are what helps people succeed as it should motivate and help make their attitude more positive through the day knowing you did good enough to improve your self.

I think that cellphones should not be allowed in the classroom because students dont do the work that they suposted be doing and schools already have tecnology to use.

Cellphones shouldn't be allowed for educacional purpose because students dont do that work that they suposted be doing. Sometimes students take pictures of homework or a test and then they pass it to a friend. They always wants to check theirs social media like snapchat or instagram. this in one reason why students fail classes or fail grades. For example, in my English class there is a guy who is always using his phone, checking his social media or checking his messages that his friends has be sending to him and he is not passing his classes.

Also, cellphones shouldn't be allowed for educational purpose because schools already have tecnology for students can use. The government gives the schools computers because they wants the students graduate and dont have any distraction by using theirs cellphones.

schools have computers or ipads and thas why teacher dont need to let the students use their phone to do any work that they have to do.

However, Students can do their work in the computer where the teacher can be checking what the students is doing, if his doing his work or not.

Some students might say that they can use their cellphones in the classroom because it is more easy for them to translate words than be looking words in the dictionary. Also, some students might say that they can't live with out using their phone. Finally, they might say that using theirs phone can be more easy because they can be checking their work any time that they want.

In conclution, I think that cellphones shuldn't be allowed in the class room. students have to learn how to live with out their phone because graduate and not fail classes is more important than be texting their friends all the time.

Schools should be the same, they could have more time to do their homework and rest, because there is stress in children. In the majority of middle schoolers and high schoolers there is always stress and preoccupations about grades. Most of high school teenagers stress and worry about colleges if they got in or not. And by taking the four-day weekend we are reserving energy and resources, by not driving cars or motorcycles because of the toxic smoke a vehicle throws to the air we breath.

Sometimes some of the big businesses become of abusive or people's hours to get extra work done. It should be people's decision if they want to stay extra hours if they want to get their work done. People work to live and not live to work they somehow got to look for ways to provide themselves and sometimes their families. If they were to finish their jobs with everything done , they get to go home and be with their families.

Having the time off can be people to catch with work if they are behind or for teenagers to catch up with homeworks. School sometimes can be exhausting because some people could be depressed or stressed out to get their things done. Everyone can run out of energy especially when everybody expects for you to do good. Every single member of your family is always telling you to do good just to get things in life is very stressful. Working hard through four days it is more then enough to get work done if you put your mind to it.

People need the extra time to relax, because it is not good for the body mentally and physically. Working too much causes stress and grueling because thinking too much about work and worrying about the bills that they have to pay. By being worried too much can even cause you to go to the hospital so it would be not be good for your health. When you think about the things you have to do to support yourself you have to put yourmind to it and not slack if you want that advantage of thedays you are going to have work.

In conclusions I agree because people should have more time to relax and not stressed about their jobs and what they have to do. People get exhausted and start to worry about all of their responsabilities they have to do. Working for 10 hours is more then enough for a person. Sometimes teeagers and adults carry many preoccupations that they shouldn't worry about but they have to if it envolves them.

974,4A9DB943D7D5,"My enjoyable educational activity I chose was soccer because it is a sport you do a lot of running. Soccer can be played all over the world. Long time ago people used to say that all sports were for men only but today men and women play sports thanks to the changing of the laws.

A day before a soccer game, players have to train so hard in order to win. They have to learn new tricks and they have to run a lot. All soccer players must have enough energy to run because it can lead to mistakes and can cause the team to lose. Soccer players need to be concentrating on the ball at all times and they have to make sure where they kick because if they kick too hard, they can hit someone in the stadium. During a game, there has been so many injuries due to running so fast and tripping players and then it causes a huge argument over the injured player. At all times if people want to be a soccer player, they have to play clean.

There are kids that want to grow up to be the best soccer player and for that they have to start early and join a team in a school or in other places that let kids play. Sometimes kids play at their house with siblings or other people in their family and that can be a good practice for a game in your team. Playing soccer is a great sport and it helps people lose weight because of the amount of running.

Some people play soccer for money because they got things to pay, others just play for fun. Some people say that soccer is just for Hispanics, but it isn't true because almost everyone plays soccer no matter the race. In soccer, it is best for your team to have a great coach and that he/she is good at teaching because sometimes its the coach's fault that they lose and he/she starts blaming everyone. Everyone has to try their best in any sport no matter what but its most important to concentrate on the sport and not be thinking about anything else but the sport because you can lose track and make your team lose and your team can be mad at you.",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.5,3.9,2
2198,A3E6A572C6E5,"Do you remember a time where whether it was your parents, teacher, or someone very close to you excepts you to be something that you are not? According to me, every parents wants their kids to be perfect, wonderful, and hard working. Every parents wants to see them successes in life, and be happy, but what they don't understand is how much pressure and anxiety they put on their child. I remember a time where i was under so much stress and pressure because my parents wanted me to be this perfect, wonderful, and hard working person just so i could be the best torture.

Do you remember a time where you wanted to do something so bad, but everyone else wanted you to do something that you don't even like and want. I remember a very good friend of mine name Generic_Name, wanted to be an artiste, but every one in her family wanted her to be a doctor. We all know that being a doctor is not an easy job. sure you get high salary but being a doctor is not about getting high salary or wearing the white uniform is about carrying for others and enjoying your time with others . But Generic_Name's family didn't understand that all they care about was her getting in medical school and be a doctor. Generic_Name is very smart, carrying, and wonderful person. because of her family pressure her to be a doctor she let her dream go and now is suffering very much, because she doesn't want to be a doctor she wants to be an artiste something that she wanted to do her whole lives. That's why we should never pressure someone to be something that they are not.

dreaming and working hard to be something that you always dreamed of is very hard when you have people, who constantly try to make something out of you that you know that you are not. One example of that is when i was little i always dreamed of becoming the greatest dancer at all time, but everyone was against what i wanted to do. i remember i had to set down and have word with my family i had to explain to them why i want to be what i want to be. I was under so much pressure, stress, and anxiety that i thought i was in a war with my own family. Everything i said or do they use it against me it was very sad, angry, depressed, and unhappy moments, but i get though it i did become a dancer, i did something that i thought i could never do, and i didn't let anyone to shut me down with their words or actions. The lesson that we could learn from my story is not to stand against your family and disrespected, them, but no to allow anyone to take your dream away from you. Always stay strong and never give up.

""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" According to me every person in this world have the right to speak their mind and do whatever they wish or desire. No one should every try to make you something that you are not. In today's world we people try to make changes in others life by trying to make them something that they are not and that's where we lost loves one, friends and family just because we choice to do things we wanted insisted taking their advice and changing our path. We should be doing the thing we love and dreamed of no one has the right to tell you otherwise. You should never change yourself to make others happy or to show them you care about them, because if they really care about you they will accepted you for you.

Changing yourself for other just so could show them your carrying, perfect, and happy is not love. Everyone has the right to be happy in their lives and we should accepted them they way they are. To give you an example of what i am talking about is i had a friend name Generic_Name he was very hard working guy who was loved by everyone in the community. Generic_Name was born in single family he was living with his mom and two younger brother. Generic_Name's mom was a wonderful women who was loves by everyone. Generic_Name was the older child so he had a lot of responabilty he had to work to provide for his family, he had to go to school, and take care of his younger brothers'. when Generic_Name get accepted to college he wanted to study biology but his mom wanted him study music but Generic_Name was never interested in music. he want to learn about living and nonliving things, but Generic_Name's mom never agree with him she told him"" you have to study music and that's that."" Generic_Name was my best so when he told me about his problem i told him"" Listen Generic_Name i know you love your mom so much, but do what you love to do will make you happy and you don't have to be something that you are not interested in because you will suffer in the future"". Generic_Name loved his mom so much he didn't want to make her sad so we he went to college and he study music, but he never like what he was doing because he was born to be a biologist. The lesson to learn in this story is to never give up your dreams for your loved ones because once you started doing something there is no way back.

In the future knowing that you did something for yourself and knowing that no matter what other said you did what you love to do is the greatest accomplishment that you could ever accomplish. Some say to be yourself is not the great accomplish but i disagree with that because being yourself, not losing hope, not giving up, and fighting with others trying not to be something that they are make you to be is the greatest accomplishment.

Students can come up with really creative projects over summer by researching experiments, or about someones life. A student can look up science experiments to do as their projects that could be entrusting for the class or for them selves to. Also they can talk about a famous person or about someone in their family and explain why they wrote about that person. Students can invent new projects and show off to the class and explain how they came up with it and what will their invention help them or others.

Students could have more fun creating their own projects. Students will be more exited to be able to do create their own projects then follow a boring one a teacher assigned everyone. Students can come up with really creative work if you let them free roam. Students could in joy doing work that doesn't have to follow a checklist. Students could also can work on a project with their friends.

Lastly students can feel less stress about doing a project. Students will be able to work on a project without having to stress about it being perfect or if its following the checklist.

2758,CA73BDEC2752,"I disagree with what John Lubbock saids ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" I strongly disagree because we are influnced by the people we hang out with. Like for example in America we have diferent accents all around the map and thats because the people near us influnce one another. They influnce one another by sharing cultures and beliefs. For example in louisiana they have martigra but it did not originate in louisiana, in new york they have a lot of italian people, and we all enjoy eating ethic food such as chinese food, tacos, pupusas, italian food. All of those things influnced americans and their traditions and customs which impacts thier morals.

As we all know everyone has morals but those morals are influnced by people, such as our friends, family, teachers and coworkers. Ones morals has a big role in character. I would even say its the biggest factor in what builds pur character. A persons moral is what tells them what is right and what is wrong, what they should do or what they should not do, wether to pick option A or option B. Morals are a part of someones character, its what builds thier charater. For example if someones morals aren't made up and they do not know what is good and bad then thier character might need some work.

I get where Mr. Lubbock gets the idea of ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it"" but I also think that social class has alot to do with your character. I think that the different social groups have a varaity of character building factors. I believe this because for example a person that only makes 20 grand a year has a lot more struggles than a person that makes 100 grand a year and those struggles impact ones character.

In conclusion I disagree with John Lubbock because I believe morals, social class and people around us influnce our character. I believe all those factors play a major role on who we are because it is human nature to adapt to surroundings. ",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.7,2
1823,89857315A1A4,"How to distribute forty work hours a week most usefully? Nowadays, a four-day work week is very rare, because this system is new; people always being careful when something new come out, but then they understand it is better. The four-day schedule is more balanced, energy and money saving and variable. This is why, I believe, our school should should follow the new schedule.

First, the forty-day school week is more well-distributed, because the students would have more time for rest, doing homework; so their ability to study will have been raised. On another hand, ten hours in school might be exhausting for the pupils, but the school administration may make breaks longer and more frequent to solve the problem of tired students

Second, the four-day schedule lowers the use of energy and resources. The school would use less electricity to heat and cool the building; it will spent less money for servicing the students and investigate saved money to science researches, equipment and study program development.

Third, with the sour-day schedule the pupils become more free: they might share more time with their family and friends; spent more time for their hobbies and working. The students may hardly learn if they are late for making project or plan the interesting and fun weekend in the three days; the bad thing about rest four days: you will not rest. School days will be very busy, hard; but maybe more educational and efficient. Long ten hours in school might be uncomfortable for the students, who do extra curriculum activities like preparing courses, art clubs and sports. However, our school has all comfortabilities to do extra curriculum activities inside the school's building, so the students do not need to go anywhere else.

To conclude, the four-day school week seems experimental for people yet; but when something new is thought the people realize an idea is innovative, then the idea becomes an action, which becomes regular.   ",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.7,2
3000,D743AC1EB08D,"how conserve energy and resources

The energy, and the resources are the most important factors in the world, for the evolution and survival of the human. There are many types of resources such as money, products, and energy power. Factors that have supported the human life for long time, and actually continue it happening. Every body in this world must be career it, because these resources are helping us to survive ,and support our life style. But the sad-reality is that the human does not career it, because they do not know about the consequences or they are ignorant. We need to rectify our mistake, and keep safe our resources. This written will be about advice, benefits, disadvantages, and plans how career our resource.

Let talk about the benefits that we are go to get if we safe our resources. First, there is a plan or recommendation what is about adopt a four-day work week, with each days 10 hours work, and school days with two hours. This is as a way to save our resources, and obtain the following benefits; we are going to save the energy, food,internet, water, time (to spend in our life with the family or whatever we want), the deterioration of our clothes and shoes. We are going to help the environment to keep it safe from the pollution, to make a better style life for the humans, and save resources for critical moments in the world. As you can see there are many resources what we could save, if we have adopt this plan.

In this plan, there are many benefits but also disadvantages. For this time I am go to talk about the disadvantages, if we implement this project. There will be present many problem such as the loss of time to learn, time to work, we will lost our social life in the school as in the work, became a professional will be harder and tardy. The technology advance will be slower, and it is go to affect the human evolution. Then we will lose many important things, and resources. Factors that could support in life, and make it easier.

In conclusion, There will be many people whom will benefit from this project , but at same time it is go to make many problems cause the disadvantages. If we implement this plan, we must be able to understand, we are go to take our risk. Moreover we must be think about the risky that this could be, and prevent more problems than we already have. I recommended do not waste our time anymore, starting to create a better world with a better life style, and creating new project to save resources. This support or this type of project need to be created by the government, because they are whom have the power to control whole country. Now take career our resource became a new goals for me after reflect a topic as this. We are going to understand that is necessary protect our resources, because they are indispensable to keep us alive and keep going with this life what we have in the twenty-one century.

2177,A2957D006D28,"It has been said that the first impression are almost impossible to change. I disagree because when you look at a person for at three seconds you think you know that individual already, Until you have a conversation with him/her for at least ten seconds your whole impression will change with a ""blink of a eye"". However, I disagree the first impression is almost impossible to change. The reason why is that the way a person looks, personality, and there way communication skills are all ways that can change your whole point of view of a individual. From your first impression when you look at them.

However the way a person looks from your first impression isn't always who they really are. Base on you information on someone aren't ever really true. Meaning looks can be deceiving. Ex. The guy/girl could be the cutest person you ever seen and you really want to meet them. Until they were the worst nightmare and you hate them with a passion. This also works vice verse. Ex. The guy/girl could be the ugliest person of the time, but you never gave them the time of day. Until you met them and started talk to each other. That's when you realize that this person is the one for you. It's like saying don't judge a book at its cover. Until you opened it and read it. That's when you really like this book. Sometimes a personality can be a huge factor on your first impression.

Neverless personality can change your first impression. Personality is mostly made up of whom you are. The basic qualities, and beliefs you have on a individuals. Find out who someone can be a life changing event for yourself not knowing who someone really is can have a big affect on you, because you really don't know who you are dealing with. Personality provides great insight into individuals and their lives. Being honest no matter what with someone can build a strong first impression on yourself and the person right in front of you. Showing the courage to do what's right in those situations, being loyal at your friends and love ones are good ways to boost you relations with another individual. Having the drive to keep going can rise-up your personality and your first impression to a different climax. Communication is key to your first impression.

Furthermore, communication skills consist of verbal and non-verbal by transferring information to another individual. Communication involves displaying confidence, and passion to show that you understand the individual topic by being eye contact and hearing all information that they are telling you. By you giving your honest opinion on a situation can grater your chances being with that individual, when keeping an open mid and resisting to give your quick judgments are clear signs of good communication skills.

Additionally. I disagree that first impression is almost impossible to change. The reason why is that the way a person looks, their personality,

and their communication skills are all ways that can change your whole point of view on a person. In other words, looks can be deceiving personality because being honest no matter what is key, and communication skills are caused by you first impression. Therefore by taking the time, day, hours, and efforts to get to know someone can benefit you from not judging book by its cover.            ",4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.1,2
1423,6D104CA14B33,"75% of the time students graduate early to go to college. Matter of fact I believe that students should graduate in three years and work, because they would save money for college, they will be mature for college, and they would have time management skills. This will help students gain lots of opportunities before college.

First, students would have the opportunity to save money for college. Some students like to get a loan for college, because they don't have enough money, and parent's can't support him/her. But if students get a loan for college, then they would have to pay it back after college. If students get out of school in three years, then they have the chance to work and save money for college. Students won't need a loan if they work, and the parents would not have to worry about the money. This is good, because students would have to rely on themselves, and have responsibilities. This will show others that you matured, and will make your parents proud.

Secondly, students who work will be more mature, because they would have to rely on themselves, have lots of responsibilities, and they would understand the outside world better. Some students who graduate early tend to be 17 years old. If they do the one year work force, then they would gain money and become more mature. Maturity matters, because students need to understand how to turn in work to their professor on time. Being mature will make you an adult, and make others take you serious, not a joke. Some students get bullied, because they are younger than everyone else, and we do want that happening to anyone. But if you do work that one year you graduate early, then you will get into college the same year your friends are, and you won't have to worry about being alone.

Lastly, Some students don't turn in school work on time. Work could gain the student time-management skills, because they would have to be at work on time, do what they have asked to do on time, and never be late. Time management skills will help you in school by, turning things on time, not being late to class, and sleeping early for the class you have the other day. Time management skills isn't only for being late and turning work in on time, time management is also important for setting a time to sleep and to wake up. It also helps you by having a time for each thing you do, like studying, working, playing, relaxing, and sleeping. If you have all of that set, then you don't have to worry about being late or not turning anything on time, because they would already have the time management skills and you would be used to it already.

I believe that others might disagree with me and say that students should go to college right away, but with all do respect I believe that students would gain a lot of opportunities if they work before going to college, because if you go to college and you aren't mature enough, then you will struggle.

In conclusion, I believe that students who work before going to college, will gain a lot in life and they will be ready for college. Because they wouldn't have to worry about paying the loan off after college, they would have a better time management skills than others will, and they will become more mature by being responsible and handling it themselves.

3500,EEEF07B3D146,"Do you accomplish more when you always keep yourself busy? In this essay i will argue that keeping yourself busy serves a purpose. You get more things done, you will not be considered lazy and you get to learn new things.

When you are always doing something you get more things done and out of the way. You will not be behind on anything. This is a good habit to have because it can affect you in the long run. For example, when you get older and have to pay taxes or bills. You will be caught up and on time which is really good for your credit score.

You will not be considered lazy. Many people in your life will notice how you like to get things done. This habit will definitely get you a job. No employer is looking for someone lazy and does not like to do things. Keeping yourself busy can be therapeutic. Many people do this to relive stress or think about things instead of being useless.

You will learn new things. Take advantage of the things you do because it can lead you to new opportunities. You can experience different things which is phenomenal. It is always fun keeping yourself busy because you feel great after the things you have accomplished. The more things you learn the more things you can try to keep yourself busy.

Some people say inactivity serves a purpose, but they are wrong because when you are always doing something it keeps you motivated, experienced and makes a good habit to have. In the future I hope we have less useless people and more people who like to get things done.  ",4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.1,2
3136,DD279F25DC1F,"""Oh my God Generic_Name,"" I did not have enough time to finish my power point, me too Generic_Name said. I think our school should add two hours more and we should come four-day school weeks like some businesses they work for ten hours and they only work four days it can benefits students and teachers because, some students can have more time to do their homework, some teachers and students can saved more gas and money, and some students can ask their teacher for more help.

First,students and teachers saved more gas and money. For example, my friend needs to drive herself to school everyday and she needs to pay for her gas. The other day she told me that coming to school for five days is stressful because, she has to pay for gas and she is not working everyday like she just too, so her parents have to pay the gas for her .They told her if she do not start to pay for her own gas they where going to take the car away from her, I told her about how some businesses have adopted just going four- days to work for ten hours and I told her that our school should have four-day school week too, I think that would be a good idea and she thinks that is a great idea too, because she gets to saved money and gas and she do not have to worry about paying a lot of money for gas anymore and her parents would not be mad at her anymore because she would have the money to pay for gas.

Other example can be my Spanish teacher she lives a little far from school and she has to drive to school, but she is having some problems and she does not have enough money to pay for her gas. She told me that if she do not get the money to pay her gas she was going to be absent for some day into she get the money to buy gas for her car, that make me so sad because she is my favorite teacher, she is like a mom to me, and she would not be able to come to school just because she dont have enough money to pay her gas. My friend told her about what I said and she things its a great statement because she would have more time to grade students homework ad would have more time to spent with her family.

Second, students can have more time to do their homework. For example, myself sometimes in my math or chemistry class we talk about something new and it takes almost the hold class and my teachers give us a lot of homework so I think the if we go school for ten hours it would be great because I would have a lot of time to do all my homework or I would have time to study too and I would just get home to relax and I would not get stress because I already did my homework.

Other example can be my best friend Generic_Name, she is taking all AP classes, and she gets a lot of homework sometime she does not get the enough time to finish her homework in class and when she gets home she has to take cared of her little sister, so she does not have time to finish her homework at home or sometimes she has projects do the next day but she does not have enough time finish in class. Generic_Name said that she gets really stress about all her homework and how she has to do it in so little time, she thinks if we go to school for more time she would have a lot of time to do her homework and she would just go home and take care of her little sister, she should not have to be stress about doing her homework.

Another example can be my friend Generic_Name, she loves to do homework because she likes to compete with other students, but ladle she has being so worry and angry about everything. I ask her why does not she compete with the other kids like she used to, she told me because she has a lot of test's coming up and she needs to study and that she wish that we have more time in school so she can get everything done the same day because now she has to take her homework to her house and finished over there, now she does not get time to relax and chill like she always did.

Third, some students can ask their teacher for more help. Like myself the other day in math class we were talking about a new topic it was so hard that I did not understand the topic. After the teacher show us how to do it, I was asking for help every three seconds because I did not understand, after she explain me for the hundred time I was still confused, before the class end she gave us homework I did not how to do the homework ether, so I stay after with her so she could it explain me again, but the after school time is only for fifteen minutes. My teacher explain me again and show me how to do it again but I did not get it, she told me the if we have more time in school hours it would be better because would take her time and explain us how to the work more slow, but we only have like one hour in her class so we do not get enough time ask a lot of questions. Other example, my friend Generic_Name sometimes his teacher talk so fast that he can understand what she is saying, he want it to stay after school so she could explain him again, but he could not stay because needed to go soccer practice he being missing a lot of day because he always stay after school with a teacher for extra help and if he does not start going to soccer practice again, his coach is going to kick him out of the team, he is the only one that has been missing a lot of days, and he needs to get back in track because his team has a really important game coming up, so he can not stay after school for help anymore.

Some students think that they get stress for being in school for a lot of time;however, they are wrong because some students think that if they go to school for a lot of time they would get more time to do their homework.

Some students and teachers get to saved more money and gas, some student can have more time to do their homework, and some students can ask their teacher for more help this are some benefits of why should my school adopt a four-day school week.",4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.7,2
745,39524C93F4D4,"People will tell you that without doing something, you'll never get what you want. I agree. Accomplishing something is a great feeling when you know you've done it because when you know you put in the time and effort for it and get a great result. It shows that the time you toke to make it was worth it. Sitting around, letting people hand you stuff will get you no where in life, because instead of you doing something, you wait for them to give it to you, not aware of what that person had to do to.

What does it mean to accomplish something? To me accomplishing something is when you worked hard for what you did and you're satisfied with your result. That to me is accomplishing something. Whenever I set my mind to anything, I do whatever it takes to make it. For example, I had a championship finals in a week and I needed time to prepare my mind and body for the game. The time came to play the game and all I could think about was winning that trophy. We ended up winning, and I won what I was waiting to accomplish. I don't think I could have made it if I didn't make an dedicate my time to win the finals.

Kids nowadays are spoiled by there parents to get whatever they want just by asking. I can understand that some parents care about what the needs of there own children, but I often see parents buy usless things for there kids and that can be a problem because when they know they can get these things that aren't any use for them,

they go asking for other stuff that they don't need. A solution to this problem can be when they are old enough to get a job, to get one so they can make money, so they can buy things for them selves. Instead of leaching on Mommy and Daddy's money all the time. Getting a job shows that you're doing something to get what you want, for example, a house, a car, anything you can spend you're own money that you need. The effort you showed got to where you are and now you know you accomplished it.

A person I know that has accomplished alot in his life is Cristiano Ronaldo. He is a soccer athlete and was born in a small town in Portugal. Like others there, his family was really poor and couldn't afford him anything really. He was a trouble child in school and misbehaved when things didn't go his way. He was very talented in soccer though. He would go outside, find anything round and did whatever he would do to a real soccer ball. He was noticed by coaches when they would here a young kid scoring goals not any normal kid would. He moved to the capital of Portugal and would play for the towns Division one team. He never forgot his family back home. He would have made a ton of money to send back to his family and bought them a house in a much nicer and safer location. His goal was to be the best player in all of soccer. He worked in and out of practices to get better and play for a club that people would notice that he was. He was bought by one of the greatest teams in all of europe Real Madrid. He was the most highest paid athlete at the time and whenever he got his pay check, he would always use it for a good cause like, family, charity, etc. He would eventually be nominated for the best player award five times and would end up winning those times. He accomplished what he had dreamt of becoming, and I hope people could see his story and realize you can't just sit around and do nothing, you have to put in time and effort to get what you want.

I can understand when people can get lazy and not do anything to accomplish anything. Not everyone is perfect. But sooner or later they'll realize that without doing something, you can't get what you want. Sometimes people are fortunate to recieve things just by asking, but do you want to live a life leaching off people? Letting them know ""oh this person can't live without me because I get him everything"" I know I wouldn't. I hope to accomplish here that, you have to make an effort in order to accomplish something.

2165,A1CA2A691C98,"Do I agree or disagree on Ralph Waldo statement well I agree on what he is trying to say because you can master beyond something and get somewhere in life.

Also following your dreams and do what you want to do. Try not to follow anyone's decisions they make for you because it's not right for them to do so. It's your path to choose what you have set in life. You can master things in life if you believe in yourself and never give up. But people can tell you that you aren't too good for things and you should give up on everything.

If you were to master something important you will get somewhere in life. It can start by graduating from any school. If you mastered graduating from school it can get you a new job where you can do something better and you can grow from it. Also you can be willing of having a family , that for me it's a huge thing to have because they will help you get better opportunities. However mastering what you can it can take you to places and you can improve to becoming something better. Trying your hardest is a big key note because if you don't you may never get to become what you want and you may never grow from it.

What do I want to do and should I follow my dreams or goals. By following what you want to do you can become the next big singer out there. If you want to achieve something no one believed you can do you can become the next president. Also by thinking out of the box it can make you do things you have always wanted to do. However if you believe in yourself you can be a professional soccer player without being so ostentatious. But people can bring you down and you can always bring yourself back up if you believe that you can do it.

How can I not try to follow anybodies decisions they make for me. Well you always have to make sure that things are about you even if you don't want it to be about you. People can make you do things so you can give up on something you set you goal on. Don't listen to what they say or on what they want to tell you. It's not good for you to have negativity around you. Also you have to efface on what people have to say about what you do or how you are going to do it . However make your mark and show them what you can achieve and make the people who believed in you proud that you did it.

When someone has something so positive to say that can change someones thinking I have to agree to what he or she has to say and it's true we do have to master beyond something or we will never grow. To never give up on following your dreams and what you have set your goals for . Also try not to listen or follow what anyone decides for you and try to make it about what you want it to be . If you mastered that goal by you having them set then you will be going to places and having great opportunities. It's hard if you don't do things you have set your mind to because you will go nowhere. But you can always get advice from people whom you think will help you out.

3602,F3259CFA6566,"Being yourself brings out the better you in a person. When you are yourself your a better person because your not changing yourself to be someone your not. Sometimes its good to change in your life but don't loose the way you are to be someone worse because your attitude and personality is what stands out the most in you. Most people change because they want to be a better person or they are tired of being so quiet and keep to themselves. The way someone is shows the kind of person you are and to try to change back to the person your not anymore could be difficult because you are changing your ways as a person.

Firstly; being yourself means you are unique in your own way. You don't have to change yourself to prove a point to someone. No matter how mean, rude, disrespectful you are you can't really change the reason I say that is because that is how you are already as a person. Most changes can occur maybe from someone loosing another person like they passed away and it hurts you so much you loose yourself as a person. Changes can reflect you as to what goes on in your life. Like maybe you suffer from abuse, violent actions, or even depression that can change you as a person. Just by being yourself and pushing yourself to change can be such a big change in your life even maybe to your family that are already used to you being a certain way. If you want to change your way of being change to be someone better the who you are now because out don't want to be the person everyone talks about. Just by being yourself you should care about what other people think about you because you are who you are and no one can change that.

Secondly; just by changing you can loose your inner self. You had already been trying to be someone that you like or maybe even respect. If you want to change you should do it for yourself don,t do it for your friends because at the end of the day they won't care who you are or what you are. Most of who you are and what you do can reflect you as a person of good. One thing my grandma would say to me is "" sweetie be yourself don't change yourself for anyone because no one will respect you and love you like your family will"". Be you don't push your inner self away because no matter how rude and annoying you are your still one of the best person in your family. No one deserves to be changed just because people think your not a good person already. Show your inner person because you are probably hiding someone you haven't brought out yet. Most people can bring you down just by talking about you are even getting other people to hate you maybe because your to quite or your not a good person. Be you unique in your own way and show everyone that you are good with who are already.

Thirdly; your personality shows your character as one. No one wants to b friends with someone that he or she is better than everyone else because thats not true. You should always show where you come from even if you are poor and dont live in such a beautiful house. One reason i could say is because most of those things show that you dont care about what people think or say bout you because everyone stands out as who they are. Don't be someone you'll eventually regret being because that could reflect on you changing. If one of your friends, cousins, siblings stops talking to you dont bring out a mean person you weren't supposed to be because they could pull away from you and not want to be near you again. You also can't be a coward just because someone gives you advice on changing the way you are because maybe they are trying to help you be someone better and of good. Be the person that stands out for being himself or herself and not the one that everyone says oh they copy everything

I get or ever wanted to be more popular somewhere be more known as a person.

Fourthly; Changing back someone you had already change to can be difficult because you had already pushed away the person you didnt want to be. Trying to go back to that person you used to be can be long ago by the time you try to change back to that person. Most of the people that pushed away from you now may never come back because of you changing who you are and or were at one point. Most of things you did to change yourself can just now affect you and can never be out back together again. Be yourself dont be that person that tries to back to him or herself just because you dont like the now you. You decide to change to be a better person so move on and keeping that person you wanted to be at one point. You've changed for a reason so now you should em braise it and love your change. Who you chose to be will be that same person you'll possibly be one you are more grown into life.

Lastly; be yourself and dont try to change yourself to be someone your not. Who you are now could help you throughout the rest of your life. Maybe not always be yourself but dont do it or someone that doesnt deserve to see a change in you do it for yourself. Do everything to try and be your own and unique person all at one because a lot of people would like to around you. Just by being yourself could always reflect on who you want to be once you grown up and leave from your families home.",5.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.4,2
3255,E2C3F26AB94D,"Something I'd like to accomplish in the future would be to practice my singing because it makes me happy, it can turn into fun and games with your friends, it helps relieve my stress, and you can freestyle when you sing. Lastly, I think that singing is very fun and helpful.

Singing makes me happy because whenever I'm done singing a song it makes me smile. Once I'm done singing a song I'll have the urge to sing more because I love to sing. Ever since I was a little girl I would occasionally ask my dad to sing to me and ever since then I've always been passionate about singing. I sing whenever I'm sad and then I choose a song and I'll sing to the song I chose and it'll make me happy.

Me and my best friend play around a lot and when we do we'll start singing but in a fun way. We'll be so off key. And start goofing around. We'll do singing contests. This one time we did a singing contest that went on for hours and it turned out to be a tie. So we did a rematch and she won that rematch. So we had another one then I won.

Singing has been helping me relieve my stress a lot lately. Because since SOL's are like right around the corner I've been singing to just get my mind off everything that's stressful. I felt relieved to sing because I hadn't sung in quite a while. I also felt very happy to sing, after singing I was energetic.

In conclusion,

I think that singing is very fun and helpful and it can also get your mind off anything that bothers you.",3.0,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.6,2
3717,F7FD0CB34BBC,"Everyone has a talent or skill. For Example, my talent is drawing. Drawing is really useful because I can use it for a lot of things like school projects,plays,and more. To get good at something I enjoy doing it takes a lot of time and effort for me to be good at the activity i enjoy doing. Every one has a talent or skill but the only way to develop that talent or skill is by hard work,practicing,and doing it constantly.

Firstly,everyone has a talent or skill but the only way to develop that skill is by working hard. For example,when I first started drawing. when I first started to draw i was really bad,cause i didnt practice at all. However,when I started to put that hard work in I started to get good at drawing and then i saw that I can only get better by working hard. Moreover,working hard is a chance for me to show my self what im capable of doing. Working hard is good for me because im challenging my self to do better in life as I get older and get better in my skills and talents. As can be seen,just by working hard can take someone far in life to achieve greatness.

Secondly,everyone has a talent or skill but the only way to develop that talent or skill is by practicing it. For example, my friends talent is playing soccer. My friend is really good at soccer because he practices and trains everyday. Even though my friend is small and skinny he doesnt care who he plays against because he can play with people twice his size and double his weight and still play good. For example,one day I went to see my friend play in a tournament. The day of the tournament was beautiful because the sun was out,the sky was blue, and the temperature was perfect. After a few minutes of us waiting, the game finally started and we got to see my friend play. At the beginning of the match my friend was going through everyone because of how he was playing. My friend was running so fast that he looked like a cheetah running for the ball. After the match was over they ended up winning the whole tournament because they had the most points which made my friend really happy cause all that hard work had finally paid off. Later we went to eat at a restaurant which smelled like flowers and the food tasted like if it was from heaven. As can be seen,practicing can take people to achieve greatness.

Lastly,everyone has a talent or skill but the only way to develop that talent or skill is by constantly doing it. For example,when my dad started to learn how to play the guitar. At first my dad was really bad because he had never played a guitar in his whole life,so he told his friend to teach him hot to play it. My dads friend told him everything he needed to know on how to play it,so my dad started playing the same notes constantly until he learn how to play it. Further more,having a talent is awesome because it can help people with daily day challenges. For example,if im playing a soccer match and my talent is playing soccer im going to do good,or if im in school and i have to do a project and my talent is drawing im going to get a good score because thats where im good at. As can be seen,practicing constantly can improve someones talents or skills.

In conclusion,everyone has a talent or skill they just need to know how to develop that talent or skill. By practicing,working hard,and constantly doing it can be improve a persons talent or skill. Do you think its helpful to have a talent or skill?",3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.6,2
1388,6B2FD789B8C8,"To converse energy and resources, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. My school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours. This model will be helpful for students, and teachers at same time. By giving them more time to relax. It be the best option for students because it will give them more time to experience, learn new information in a young age. We all as a student need more time to prepare for future, and work as hard as possible to pass our classes. Furthermore, same for the teachers, they will be able to have more time with their families; and they can enjoy their lives with three days weekend. My school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours because teachers and students will have more time to relax,

to grow and achieve more, and to help others.

We all need to relax, specially if we are a student because school is so stressful, and two days weekend will not give enough time to students to relax. Two days weekend will just be enough for students to spend time with their families and do their homework; it will not give them time for themselves. Moreover, by two days weekend students can not relax and work for themselves. I personally rather to have more time during the weekend because I will have more time to finish everything that I wanted to do during the week, and I will have time to relax. During the weekdays students can learn more and they will have more time in school to spend with their friends. Some people think that three days weekend will make students forget what they learned during the week. But they are wrong because students will have more time to go over what they learned, and they have enough time to practice more.

Most of the people loves to exercise, read, meditate, and swim in their free times. Three days weekend will give students and teachers more free time to care about themselves. Most of my friends love to exercise, but some of them gave up on exercising because they don't have time to do it. They are working Saturdays' and studying on Sundays'. One of my teachers told me, that she loves to read book in weekends, but she does not have time to read because she has a lot of work to do. Reading, exercising, meditating, and swimming will help human to grow and learn more to achieve more. Also, four days weekdays will teach students to work harder. Some people think that students and teachers should not have longer weekend than usual because they have winter break, and spring break. But they are wrong because longer weekend can help both students and teachers to care more about themselves by giving them free time.

Some of the students love to help others, by volunteering. Three days weekend will increase students chances to help others because they will have more time to do it. My sister loves to volunteer and help other; she is volunteering once a month. She told me that she wants to increase it and do it more, but she can not because she has a lot of homework and she does not have time. Although, their are a lot of students who need help in some of their classes because they have a bad grade. If we give the students more time to study, they will get better grades. Last year during winter break, my math teacher told me that I have to try harder and study more, I told him that I can not understand the notes. We met in the public library and he helped me to study. He said, ""I love to help students outside of school, but I don't have time to do it"". I think we have a lot of teachers like that, who wants to help students outside of school, but they don't have time. If we have longer weekends, teachers will be able to help more students. Some people think that schools should have two days weekend because they are not getting tired. But they are wrong teaching and learning are the most hardest things in the world.

To converse energy and resources, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. my school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours. And this will help students and teachers to have more time to relax, to care about themselves, and to help others. Students can have more time with their families,

to grow, and to work harder and achieve their goals. Furthermore, teachers are also the same, teachers need more time to spend with their families and kids, and they will be able to plan what are they going to do, or what they want to do with certain students who needs help. Also, in weekdays they can learn more, or teach more. Which it is a great opportunity to both of them to achieve more. ",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.6,2
1340,6712BD512DB7,"I agreed that the greater of us lies and not in setting our aim high or low, but setting our aim too low will achieve our mark because many people around us are down and falling for some reasons. But, they are trying their best to climb up to the top in order to achieve their goals and learning from their mistakes. However, many others are lying or cheating to get a better score and failing down slowly. In fact, many people are working-hard to accomplish the goal that they want to achieve.

Setting our aim too low will achieve our goals because people have a weakness in their job and that's the reason why that they should be trying their best to fix their mistakes. I used to failed my math class last year because I didn't understand the unit because it's was too hard for me. So, I started to stay after school with my teacher and asking questions because I want to make sure that I understand the lesson. However, that didn't work out a lot as I expected because the assignment was different from what my teacher was explaining to me. But, I did not give up yet so I decided to study more at home and do some research about the lesson. And I finally understood the lesson. No matter how hard the work is, but what's important is that I put my time and efforts on it.

Another reason why setting our aim too low will help us achieve the goal is that by trying your best and work hard for it in order to achieve. However, many people are cheating to get the their goal so easily. My best friend got a high score on the test because he cheated and the test was hard as well. The teacher was wondered how did he got a high school on the test because he was the only one who got the highest score in the class, then he lied to my teacher that he studied a lot last night. But, the teacher caught him cheated on the test by using the notes because his answers was exactly as the notes said. So, it's not a shame that you are failing at something; but, it's a more worst that you lie to people and start falling down.

Also, setting our aim low will help us achieve the goal because many people are working-hard to get what they want. During the summer break, I told my mom that I want a new computer because my old computer is glitching and broken down a lot. Then, she told me that I work to earn money and get the new computer. She also said that it will helps me learn more things about the world. So, I started to work at a small restaurant and my position was cashier. It helps me counting the money faster and also it helps me improve my positives toward the other people.

Many people disagreed that setting our aim low won't help us to achieve our goal because sometime lying could be good for some reason and achieve the goal very easy. However, once the people find out that you're lying to them then you know the consequences. Sometime people starting at the lowest score to the highest score because they are doing their best of abilities to get the what they wanted to.

In conclusion, starting at the lowest point to the highest point will help you figure out what you need to do or learn in order to reach the goal. For example, if you don't try your best to achieve your goal and it's the worst thing that you could've ever done. However, the other are spreading lies to people how they achieve their goal easily and convincing people to be like them. But, keep trying your best and never give up to achieve your goal; then, you can get what you want.",3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.7,2
2856,CF4E6D77F514,"Our cell phones could help us in many situation, but they can also distract us in many ways. Some teachers thinks that they should let their student use their cell phones for educational purposes while other don't. Cell phones could affect a student in their process of learning.

A cell phone can be a distraction for anybody specifically for a student. If students are allow to use their phone in their classroom for educational purposes they could get distracted with the other apps on their phone. For example: Sanpchat, Instagram, Facebook, or even a text message. All of this apps could distract the student from doing what he or she is supposed to be doing in the class.

All students most do their own work at all time to show the teacher what he or has learned in class. Having access to a cell phone in class could tempt the student to cheat on their class work or test. Also students could send each other answer through a text. Classroom should be a red zone at all time so students won't have the chance to cheat in their work.

Every student should be focus on one specific thing thing while they are in school which is to have good grades in their class. By being able to have access to their cell phone in class the student won't try as hard to keep their grade up. Not having their phone would push them to do better in the class. The student will have all their attention on getting their assignment done in time.

Some students know how to control them self while others can't. Cell phones are a big distraction for teenagers now days. Most of them can't go anywhere without their phone in their hands.

1911,8FFDA5B9D359,"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I agree with this statement i have three reasons why I think students should be able to attend classes from home. One reason is some students have a alot of responsibilities at home and sometimes students arent able to go to school. Some might have kids and they need to stay home to take care of there kid because nobody can babysit. That's really hard for a student to do. Trying to go to school and have a kid can be very stressful to the student.

My second reason I have for this statement is some students feel comfortable having class in there own safe environment where they feel comfortable and not anxious. There are some students that have anxiety and are not able to function in a classroom full of students that can be really hard for a person because its not easy trying to get your work done in a classroom full of students and dealing with anxiety. That can be very stressfull I feel like a student should comfortable in there learning environment because when they are comfortable they achieve better in there work. They can focus better and get work done and won't be distracted by anyone there's a lot of benefits with that. Parents would also agree that having ther child in a environment that they are comfortable in is the best way to keep there child focused and willing to pass there classes without any distractions that the child doesn't need.

My third reason i agree with this statement is students can feel more determined to do there work at home in a quiet place its very helpfull to the students needs to be sucssesful. Some students get distracted easily and can't in a classroom so attending class at home helps the student concetrate and perform better with there work.

Another reason is parents would feel comfortable with there child being at home doing school work where they are safe and focused on the right things which is school work. Some students find it easier to do things online than in a classroom so its all about personal prefrence and i agree with this because it could be hard trying to understand what the teacher is saying or talking about. It's good to have a sense of understanding when it comes to learning something that's very important for students.

My conclusion to this statement is that i agree and I think it is a great idea for schools to offer this to students because it gives students a chance to be at home and pass there classes with no distractions. It also gives them an oppotunity to sucsseed and graduate. I also agree about doing school online because some students find it easier and better than being in a classroom all day and not being able to understand the teacher. I also like this because you can do your class work where ever you are you dont have to be at home if you have somewhere to be you can take a laptop and do work. I think doing online class works for a busy students schedule its all around is a good idea and I am happy that schools are letting students do online classes its a big benefit for them that's why I agree with this statement.

2423,B403A4E28BCE,"Why do we need to seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters? Why can't we make our own decisions? It's because the adults knows what's best for their kids and they been through everything that we are experiencing right now as a teenagers. Or is it because they would like to keep us safe and make good life choices in the future? But, I think we should make our own decisions because we know what's best for us, we can learn from our mistake, and we want to be more independent.

First, when we do something bad and get in trouble for it, we know not to do it next time. For example, I had a friend and she decided to go to a party and I told her not to go because it's always a fight. Well she went and ended up getting hit in her face. I tried and warned her but she make her own decisions and I wanted her to make her own decisions so I let her go. Now she doesn't go to parties anymore.

Then, we know what's best for us. If we know something we're doing is wrong but everybody is doing it too, then we will do it just so they wouldn't make fun of us or we want to be ""cool"". But, I only do it one time, while other people keep on doing it. For example, when we choose the wrong groups of friends to hang out with. Knowing they are bad but sometimes they bring out the other side of you that nobody have seen or they get you in trouble just so you can fit into the group. Then you wonder why you even became friends with them in the first place.

Last, we don't listen our parents or any adults telling us what's right and what's wrong. we would want to figure things out by ourselves and be more independent.

We know when they telling us that we shouldn't do certain stuff because they did it before when they were younger. But we know what we're doing ( well at least some of us know). Sometime we don't tell our parents what's going on at school or on social media but somehow they find out whats going on with us. We sometimes try to hide the problem and solve it our selves but it doesn't go well.

In conclusion, teenagers today will want to do everything and not listening to the adults. When we get older and start to understand why we did all those crazy and nonsense stuff in high school or middle school, like fighting (knowing it's not going to solve the problem), making fun of other people (knowing that's not how we would like to be treated), and smoking (knowing it's bad for our lungs). We just wanted to be like everybody else"". But,

1196,5CA2DCC616C6,"Energy had become the most usable thing in the world; without energy students couldn't be able to find information for their homework or projects. In this life time is the most valuable thing students can lose. Although students would have a three-day weekend, they would not lose any minute of class, nevertheless they would have more time to work because they would go to school only four days per week, which would give them more time to earn more money at work, spend more time with family and friends, and do their homework and projects on those three-day weekend.

To begin, energy is the most usable thing everyone use, and if students do not start to conserve it, in the future it could be difficult to get. For example, technology in schools is advancing over the years. Teachers give homework and projects to students online where they have to use their smart phones, which need energy to get charge, so they can use them for their assignments. They also use internet, which requires energy to function. This proves that if Generic_School extend the school day two hours for a four-day school week to conserve energy and resources, teachers would have to start giving students homework in which they have to use books. Obviously, students would have to adapt to find information for their homework and projects in books, like old times, and stop using technology to find information.

Furthermore, students would like the idea of having a three-day weekend. For example, they could use that time for work, spend time with family and friends, and do homework and projects. This shows that students would not miss any day of school because they would spend the same amount of hours they usually spend at school, but only in four days; the two extra hours Generic_School would extend on the schedule for a four-day week, would sum the hours the students spend on a regular week, yet they will divide that time in four days. They also can earn more money if they work more hours on those days that they would have off. Students would also have more time to study for any test they may have, or do any homework or projects. Clearly, this will be a benefit for students and teachers. They would get an extra day off without missing anything at school.

Overall, students would enjoy their three-day weekend studying, working, or spending time with family and friends because they would have an extra day on the weekend. Students would also adapt to find information in books. In conclusion, if Generic_School extend the school day two hours for a four-day school, would be helpful to conserve energy and resources.",3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.7,2
3812,FBE180CF324E,"To begin, what are your thoughts on first impressions through peoples point of view? When two people interact with one another the impression is not always dependable because People are probably not themselves, People opinion change, People never have the same intellectual connection. For example Generic_Name went to the movies with his girlfriend Generic_Name, his mom Generic_Name, and his sister Generic_Name. Generic_Name tells Generic_Name to invite her boyfriend Generic_Name. Generic_Name interaction with Generic_Name was unpleasant, based on what Generic_Name saw their was a different perspective from one an other. Days later at night the family reunites and the perspective change from what Generic_Name thought at first and what she thinks now.

Secondly, periodically all around the world people are not themselves when we first interact with them. Their is always a fifty- fifty chance that people, will get to meet their real personality. Why? First because they are starting to get to know new people. Second they have no idea what to expect from people. Third, some people do above and beyond to impress. Now in days many people try to make a good impression to belong to a certain group. Sometimes they are so use to doing it that they dont even recognize that is not their true self. Society has a huge impact on how people have to impress one another that it make others be afraid to show who we truly are.

However, peoples opinion change from time to time. Visualize that we are going to the store just to buy one item. We end up buying more then one item what does that mean ? It means that are mind changes to what we want it to change to. We might set up a scenario in are minds to have very high expectations to those surrounding us ,when we are self don't have that confidence. For example Generic_Name was mad at Generic_Name for not going to the bank with her. So Generic_Namea said that they would no longer be friends. The next day she text her and said what time am I picking you up. Their was a change of opinion from night to morning.

Lastly, people never have the same intellectual connection. When you first meet someone and we are aware we want to make a connection ,we try to have some conversation to talk about. For example when people have a right there connection is because they are interested and the same things as one another. When two people dont have the same to things to talk about other might think this person is not interesting enough. People would make comments like no , your not qualify to join this group, or anything that involves having to impress another person.

In conclusion, first impression arent usually trustworthy because People are not themselves, People opinion change, and People never have the same Intellectual connection. Peoples thoughts will change eventually no mater if they had a good impression at first. First impressions never counts because we never know who might be fooling us for a job , friendship, or to be a partner. Society now in days have to look out more to make sure everythig is in order. Thats why we have people who do research and look back to records, thats why jobs and people have a process of doing things.                                      ",4.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.8,2

But you've got ot be careful with what you do or say. You can get a lot of good benefits in life. A benefit of telling the truth all the time is building new friendships and meeting new people.

On the other hand, people will have that mindset thinking that being honest is a bad thing. As you start lying more often, it can become a bad habit which you might regret later in life. Now if there's a case where you're trying to tell the truth, those same people that you have been lying too won't believe you.

As we know, technology has became one of the most important things in our lives, and people now are abusing the use of technology and forgetting to contact with the others around them. Although it has both positive and negative affects on people, but we cannot declaim that our lives have been easier and better since we have had techonlogy.

First, technology are used everyday by people at all ages because of its functions. We can complete many things online by using technology such as study, entertain, shopping, etc. For example, students use technology to serve for their learning like stuyding online or researching important things for their lessons. Lots of people also use it to play game, chat with their friends, or shopping online to relax after a hard-working day.

With technology, we can find and do almost things we need so we can save our times and will have more times to do the other activities like spending time with family, or hanging out with friends.

Second, technology helps us adpot hot problems, new informations of society faster and easier. We can read news on the websites, or watch the agenda to update more things everyday so we can have better knowlegde about things around us. Besides, many poor people have been helped by the others because the news about them have been shared wide-spread. This showed the major of technology and the care of people give to the others.

Many people said the use of technology has the limitation of human contact, and it's not all right. We can easily contact to the others by texting, calling as technology is developing . Using technology in general and social media in particular also can help us make friends. People often use Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat to add friends over the world and follow them. It is a best way to know our friends, family members' activities without asking because we don't have too much time to speak with them everyday. Otherwises, we still have to speak face to face to the others as much as possible so we can understand them better, and it also shows our care to them.

Not only technology, everything in the world also has both positive and negative sides, and the main idea is ourselves. If we use technology for the right purposes, and can limit the time of using it, technology will be very useful to our lives. In short, technology can limit human contact or not based on us so let's try using it as limited as we can and don't forget to use it right ways, right times, and right purposes.",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.7,2

In other words, first impressions are usually negative. For example, if you see a person and he or she just has a serious face, your first impression ""that person has bad vibes''. Or a type of food that looks strange to you, you automatically start saying negative things about it.

Also, peoples thoughts never seem to really change you will always see that character or thing the same way. Why? Because nothing changes everything it remains if something does change ,it changes in negative way. As an example, people get more cruel or companies start inventing products that shouldn't be together. Your mind won't change unless that person ,place or thing changes in a positive way.

So, first impressions are almost impossible to change. First impressions can change by getting more involved and finding more information about that subject but, it is impossible to change that. In the futures lets hope this world and the people and objects in it will change in a postive way so our first impressions can be possible to change.

In a normal public middle school in Maryland, a student first class starts at 8:15 in the morning and the last class ends at 3:00 pm. Which means that a student spends 7 hours and 25 minutes in school, that is a long time for a person to be receiving information nonstop. The school board should not extend the school day, because that would take time away from activities that students need or will need in the future, such as: students would have less time to do homework or study, students would have less time to participate in after school activities like sports, and students wouldl have less time to volunteer in community events.

Students would have less time to do homework or study. Students already spends more than seven hours at school and usually has 6-8 classes that last 45 minutes each from those 6-8 classes at least

3 would have assigned homework to the students which means that the students would need time to complete their homework with accuracy, if the school days werre extended students would have less time to complete their homework which means that their grade might go decrease for missing assignments.

Students would have less time to participate in after school activities such as sports, or clubs.

Every healthy person should exercise for at least 1 hour per day and at school not every student takes physical education (P.E.) as a course which leads to the thought that students might not me be getting the necessary amount of exercise per day, and even if a student did take P.E. a normal class lasts 45 minutes, which is not enough for a healthy person. If the school board were to add one and a half hours to the school day students would have less time to practice in an after school team. Clubs are just like sports are a very big thing in a school, clubs shows students opportunities they usually would not get in a school day. if the school board were to extend the school day students that are parts of clubs would probably get less time to spend time in those clubs.

Students will have less time to volunteer in community events. Community service is usually a requirement in most curiculums, in past experiences I have had to have 75 hours of community service those hours were earned for volunteer work, like helping a teacher with younger students or helping a teacher organize her classroom before the school year, etc. . Those acts were usually done after school and usually took around 2 hours. If the school board were to extend the school day srudents would have less time to finish their community service and could eventually fail beacause of not enough volunteering hours.

Overall it is just more convienient for the school board to not add anymore hours to the school day so students can have more time for their other activities like sports clubs and community service",3.5,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.6,2

The students with not pay attention to what the teacher, because they are so busy in their cellphones. Some students decide not to use it for educational purposes and uses it for other purposes. Using cellphones in class will also disturb other from learning, because they are so in to their cellphone. These are the reasons how using cellphones in class can effect them from learning.

First, you will not be able to learn if you are using your cellphone in the class. Using your cellphone in class may get you off task and u would not know what u learn today in class. Some days u would be mad and take it out on other, because of what you heard on your cellphone. Overtime your cellphone vibrate you always going to want to see what it is and that will have your attention. You will not be able to focus like you use to with our education and be on your cellphone at the same time.

Second, using your cellphone for other purposes can not help you learn what you need to learn. If you do not use your cellphone for educational purposes you would not know noting from school to know about. You can get in some problem for not using it for education. They should not have it out unless the teacher say you can for your assignment. This is why people should not use cellphones in school for these purposes.

Thirdly, people will disturb other people from trying to learn with there devices that can cause a disruption. The cellphones will ring and stop everyone from learning, because they will pay attention on whose phone is ringing.

The use of the cellular device can only be use for education and not other purposes. Last but not least, do not make your classmates fell just because you do not want to successful does not mean your classmates do.

1927,911DD337DD61,"In my opinion, students should take electives instead of music, drama, or arts. Some students may dislike to be in music or drama because they don't have experience to be singing or drawing. They should focus on what they are good at for themselves.

One reason that students should take electives, they will pay attention to their classes and finish up their work to get the credit. Some students can't multi-task if they do drama class and math at the same time. They would have to focus on the important things that they're good at. Students shouldn't be wasting time on taking drama or music classes because they may not be interested in doing those classes. It'll be easier for the students to learn more with their assignments, instead of worrying about arts or dram classes.

For example, during in my junior year, the school wanted me to take art and music. I never wanted to take art because I knew I would be awful at drawing and fail the class. I had to take music also, I was horrible playing the guitar and I was failing in that class. I've told the teacher that I couldnt take art nor music because I wasn't great at it. I just wanted to focus on my course classes, so that I can graduate and get pass all my classes to graduate my year.

Second reason that students shouldnt take it, they will finish with their course classes and will get to graduate their year. It's hard when some students can't do what others can do at drama or musics. It'll be the best opportunity for the students to focus and work hard on their course classes. They should not worry about the electives because that can be done at the end of the year. They won't have to stress about their grades to be below F if they don't take the electives. They wouldn't stress about taking electives and course classes at the same time because it'll stress them out.

Last reason, students shouldn't take advantage of making themselves work more as they are now. They should only worry about their course classes because those are the only classes that will make them graduate. Some students have no talent or experienced to do art or to be in musics classes. It's better for them to finish their course classes and then at the end, they can take their electives.

Therefore, these are the reasons why students shouldn't be required to take classes in arts, musics, or drama.                                                                                                                                 ",3.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,2

How did my brother make me competitive? He would always say that I would lose and it would change my whole perspective of things. He would always win, so it would motivate me to practice.

Reason being is because i was too nerves sent it was my first year in a much bigger school.

When you want to become someone on this life you got to do whatever you have to do no matter if you need to work and study at the sametime.

For example some parents are immingrant on this country and they did not have the opportunity that you have now so,they need to undesrtand that you want to make them pround and let you be who you want to be on this life.

I remember I had a friend who's father shot himself due to the poor choice he made which made him reflect and he figured that was the only solution.

On the other hand, some people decide to be very influential to society in a positive manner. Out of my three years of high school I was able to see some students making their way for others by not being selfish; a lot of them did volunteer work as well to help the community and to hopefully inspire others to do so as well. I actually got the opportunity to throw a kids halloween party at a church: I enjoyed it, it was a lot of fun.

Honestly, I do not feel like I am a good example nor do I feel like I am a bad one either. I make mistakes: it is how I was taught. Growing up I believed that the only way you are ever going to learn is by making mistakes and being able to evaluate the error of your mistake; only then you can truly improve yourself and help insipre other people as well.

In conclusion, I am mutual about examples being the best way to influence other people because of it not always being a positive thing due to the poor decisions some people choose to make. Truthfully I think it is a better idea to be the best you that you can be because at the end of the day there is only one of you and so many of us; it is best to stay unique.",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,2

Education can be considered to have an immense and influential extent over the preparation of individuals within the constantly expanding world. It can determine how a future employee may react to a circumstance or perhaps how they may solve it. Entire generations have been based upon education. Fundamentals such as algebra and language skills learned by these individuals have sculpted the process for man to touch the Moon and to cease global crises. All of this has possibly resulted in the world we exist in today. My perspective on the circumstance is that the school board should not increase the school's schedule due to the following: the current schedule already establishes 7 hours of probable physical and intellectual progression, students can experience more unproductive and negative entities, and that the addition of one and a half hours may produce incompatibilities towards both student and related individual schedules.

Beginning with the 7-hour process, students enter the building and perhaps have already encountered a dilemma. Certain peers may have caught the bus late or arrived earlier than allowed to. Afterwards, they could be in their classes trying to understand how a certain concept functions with another and may simultaneously be attempting to concluded a page of homework. Moving from class periods to lunch, they may find themselves perplexed at what they are going to do with their locker's present condition. Even at the end of the day they may be questioning what to do with their best friend while they both have separate projects due tomorrow. In essence, a student's day can be of highly troubling challenges as well as instances that an be excessively stressful in relation to the students alone.

With the prolonging of the day present, multiple casual difficulties may be amplified whilst new forms of faults can be felt by many students. A select few could include having to finish more assignments, receiving an increase of homework, and quite more. Certain subject periods may become uninteresting after critically focusing time upon them, and other periods may become shorter in order to cope the extension of time. Events that have a possibility of occurring throughout the day can be unintentionally imposing and certain situations may very well be perceived by an array of people as impossible to conclude with the aforementioned extension.

A final note pertaining to the topic is that a longer daily routine may lead to extensive conflict with faculty, student, guardian time frames. Students can have extracurricular activities that can require adequate time to function properly such as baseball and/or team swimming. The parents and guardians of the students may now not have time to fulfill their career schedules in order to react with their children and could result in negative consequences.

Faculty members may have to stay a longer duration to cleanse or conclude their occupational duties because of the excess of materials and activities. The people apparent within the school and to some degree outside of it could be left with the severe imbalance of two correlating but differed schedules they must interact with.

Though a multitude of negative concepts and events may be associated with the topic of extending the day, there are quite in fact a variety of benefits to such a transformation. A prolonged schedule can be excellent for the further study of a subject as well as direct application. Homework can have a higher chance of being finished within school hours. Socialization in lunch and gym sessions could be extended. However, negative concepts can still be present with the solutions, which may indicate that no matter what may be of the scenario, unproductive elements can still remain.

As previously mentioned, I take a view that is against the prolongment of the academic schedule as it relates to incompatibilities for multiple individuals, an increase in negativity, and the current time frame and activities of school.

Once again, parents and guardians may have to reduce time at their positions in order to cope with shift of schedule. Homework and subject directives may become more significant in amount and requirement, perhaps stressing the students and teachers to quite the degree. The current schedule alone has multitudes of events, activities, and concepts that are brimming in attentiveness and consumption. Benefits and negatives of the school lengthening its duration are and can be present, but truly take into consideration what a change in a time frame could result in; its impacts can be irreversibly.

Each person has their own part to do and we finish it faster than do it alone. Working in groups is better because we will have more contribution from classamtes.

Second, working in groups is better because we get more opinions. For example, every person in the group give opinions. We get more ideas if we are more than only one person.

2768,CB120B25B46E,"Students work better alone rather than in groups. Students can have more support and ideas from others in groups; however, students works better alone than in groups.

2798,CC8C5C963660,"A study found that 87% of students that participate in extracurricular activities become more involved at school. Extracurricular activities are fun you once you let yourself try something new. Most kids judge something before trying it, but if they try it might be worth it. Most people that do extracurricular have a more happier time in school because of its positive effects. I agree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students can make new friends, become more productive, and finding a passion for something new.

One reason, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because you can make new friends. When I was kindergarten there was a healthy kids club and I was a shy kid at the time. So my parents thought it would be the best for me to join the club. I was very against but still went to the club. My neighbor joined the club too so we could be together at least. When my neighbor and I came to the first healthy kids club meeting, and we were separated into different groups. A teacher called my name to leave the room with a bunch of kids in my grade that I didn't know. After we got into the room people started talking and making new friends. This one girl named Generic_Name came up to me and we started talking. After becoming friends with her, the club wasn't that bad. Generic_Name and I started to sit by each other at lunch, and played together at recesses. We are still friends together to this very day. Another example is when my neighbor started to learn baseball. As he grew up no one else in the neighborhood knew how to play baseball. He always wished he had someone to play with. Once he got into middle school he heard they were having tryouts for the baseball team. So he decided to try out for the baseball team. He made the team. He started having more friends come over to his house. He even made friends in higher grades then him. He would always being playing baseball or out having fun with his new friends. I could tell he became a more happier person, and that he has now found people he can relate to and overall have fun with too. So this is why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because you can make new friends.

Furthermore, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students become more productive. My cousin she decided to join volleyball team her freshman year. She thought it would be fun to join. She started to focus too much on volleyball. Her grades started slipping and she was told she couldn't play any volleyball games till her grades were up. She had to stay up late nights to complete extra work that would raise her grades. She thought to herself, if she went back to the volleyball team she would have to find a balance to make sure volleyball doesn't take over her whole life. She got her grades back on track and she was allowed to play in games again. She started getting used to her new schedule to balance volleyball, and school. My next example is when my uncle was in high school, he joined an after school club for mechanics. My uncle wasn't a very good child growing up. He was always skipping classes, and never show up to class. Soon he joined a mechanics club with his friends. He instantly fell in love with it. He started showing up for school, and teachers started to see him be more productive. He so after choose his job as a mechanic, and he started to save money to have his own mechanic shop. He soon went to college to learn more about mechanics. He started working in a mechanic shop to learn the experiences of working and owning a shop. He then started his own successful company. Without extracurricular to change his attitude about school, he wouldn't be where he is today. These are a few reasons why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students become more productive.

Therefore, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students can find a passion for something new. When I first joined band I didn't know what instrument I would be playing. I started to play the saxophone and became good at it. Once I started to show my teacher, he offered to put me in honor band and that I would need to stay after school to join it. I started to get new songs for honor band that challenged me. I knew when I grew up I wanted to play saxophone. I'm in middle school and I couldn't get into band this year due to my honor classes. This year I have missed playing the saxophone because its my passion. I have decided next year to do less honor classes to see if I can get back into band and get to do my passion again. My second example is about my closest cousin. She joined her after school baking classes. She started baking cakes for family events and special occasions. She finally found out when she was older she wanted to become a baker. She is now working in at a bakery nearby my house. She is always baking and learning new techniques to improve her baking skills. This year she will be graduating high school early and going to culinary school. She never knew what her passion was going to be and without extracurricular she would have never known. These are my reasons why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students can find a passion for something new.

Students making new friends, people become more productive, and find a passion for something new are reasons why I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activities. Without trying extracurricular people might never know the importance of trying something new. Overall this is why I believe extracurricular can change your life.

Maybe I can be a little annoying sometimes with my peers, but that doesn't mean that they don't like me. They hang around because they know how I am and what I do when they are around me. In the end of the day it doesn't bother me if they like me or not, because I know they are gonna come back and enjoy the day with me.

This first impression thing had me thinking about something that happen a long time ago. It's not based on my experienced, but one my best friend's that we go back a long way in middle school. He told me that he didn't like me that much so we didn't talk too much. He didn't even talked to me when we where around each other, but something happen that change our friendship. There was guy who always was there with him the guy had done something terrible and caught suspended for sometime. My friend and I started talking more, after the guy got suspended he told that he didn't like me because I was dating someone he liked that's what happen.

My first impressions where good cause everyone that I know are cool with me, but if it wasn't I could of make-up something to be good with them. This thing about first impressions is not that hard to if you have charisma or personality in you. I never had a hard time making friends, because I have personality and charisma this two things you need to have if you wanna be friends with someone or making a first impression. There was a time that I went to talk with my father-in-law that day I was super nervous to even talk to him. In the end my father-in-law was just a great guy we talk about every comment he had to talked.

I don't get nervous about nothing, but he was tall and looked like a hard-dude. Even thought I all ready knew him he still looked intimated to look at him. Her wife was the opposite of him she was pollute and nice with me, but I knew that all ready because I seen her in parties. It was a good impression in the end we broke-up in a few days, but we still friends her mom still remembers me that good. sometime it is hard to make a good impression with people you know.

It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. My conclusion I disagree about that, cause me personal I don't have issues with no one around me. It's just that you need personality and charisma to make a good impression in my opinion. So go and look for that its's not difficult to have that.

Today people can do a lot of things using technology, but there are some good and bad effects that technology cause on people's lives. Technology can cause bad effects and there are some people that they can see what is technology causing and they just prefer to continue using technology. Technology need limitation for humans.

Addiction to technology is a big problem in the world. Some people believe that technology doesn't cause negative effects on people's lives, but this is not true because technology can cause problems on people's lives.

First reason, why does technology had negative effects on people's lives is because technology cause a lot of problem on peoples. One of the problem is that today technology had a big impact on people specially in adults, kids, and adolescents. The majority of people are using technology some of them knows what it can cause if they are using this all the time. For example, some kids start using technology when they just have 4 or 5 years old, and it can cause positive effects and also can cause negative effects because they start learning, but at the same time they are creating a big addiction to cell phones. The parents have to control this and dont give to their kids cell phones because they just are kids and dont need to use technology too much. Kids can use technology to study or have fun, but they need limitation of technology .

Second reason, why does technology cause negative effects on peoples lives is because adolescents are using technology to play online. This is causing a big problem to them because they are getting addiction to this. Some adolescents just prefer to stay at home playing and they dont want to go out with their parents.

The Washington post had a article about the addiction that technology is causing on people's lives. This article says that people who are playing online are having problems with banks. For example, Some of them have to pay to play online. They can't stop playing because they have a addiction. They start using credits card of their parents and they create debt with banks.

Another reason, is if you try do your best in a situation you could end up learning something new. Lastly, if you don't put any effort try to resolve a problem you could end up back in that hole.

I agree with this quote because if you don't try to do your best in a situation you could end up regretting your decision. One reason, is the amount effort you put in to a problem could affect your future. Also, a chance to do your best to fix a problem could be a one time opportunity. One example, of this is about my cousin he could have been playing professional soccer but he didn't try his best on the tryout which made him not make the team. Lastly, if you don't do your best in a situation it could affect your life.

I also agree with this quote because if you try your best in a situation you could end up learning something new. First, if you try your best in a situation you can learn on what to improve on. One example, is about my brother he did his best on a test and got a 82 percent now he knows he has to improve in that subject. Another example, is when one of my friend's brother did his best in a race and lost which made him train more and harder to improve his speed. Overall, If you don't do your best you will not learn and improve from a situation.

Another reason, I agree with this statement is because if you don't try your best in a situation then you will end up back in the same hole. First, if you don't try to solve a problem then it will come back in to your life and you will have to deal with it again. First example, is about my younger brother who didn't try on a test and got a bad grade which made him retake the test. Also, if you try to solve a problem then you will learn from your mistakes and wouldn't commit the same mistake twice.

Then, you could learn ways to improve on, to help you solve the problem. Also, if you try your best in a problem then, when you have the same problem you will know how to solve it.

1933,918C1880FCD8,"When did you decide to research your future job?

Students should start thinking of a certain career they would want to encounter by the time they reach high school. by the time students reach high school they must have a job they're interested in. If students start viewing the concepts they need, they can become what they want to be. Also by starting early with a goal, researching, and acknowledging goals they can find a job that they would like. Also will have a distinct idea on how to succeed.

First step, In most societies students start researching different jobs at a young age, so they know what they want to become in the future. Research helps students find what they need as a teenager, for example: getting a Standard or Advanced diploma, going to College, and getting a degree. when students start encountering what they need to accomplish they will tend to work hard and start receiving the information they desire. Also research gives a better understanding for the student to know what to find. Although some may say ""Information online may be false"" but there are multiple sites you can examine to observe the true facts.

Second reason, Goals help students with finding a career to start. Goals help by giving an idea to a student of what the second step is, to find the best career for them. Goals can be both limited and unlimited. Although some may say ""Students should start thinking after they graduate high school because there's many jobs in life students might pick the wrong job"", but starting young helps the teens mind to find different careers. Also students can decide what they would want to commit to.

Third reason, Acknowledging your goal will take a very important role of students life's. If students complete their goals, and research they can acknowledge their goal. Examine the work they have finished and look through to check if they are missing anything. After students have finished their steps students may continue on finding a job that they want from the data they collected. Finally acknowledging goals will help in examining job duties.

In conclusion students should start finding a job early. Starting young will help each individual student with, finding a job, how to determine if the job is right for you, and following along with accomplishing every goal. Students will have a less stressful time finding the right job. These 3 steps will help students find the right job: Goal, Researching, and Acknowledging their goals.

The first way art would help the students is by making them more patient. When you are doing art and using paints, sometimes you have to wait until it dries so you can add more details and etc, that is one way that art can help them be more patient. You have to be patient when you are making realistic drawings, because if you draw fast you might forget to add important details and the drawing may not come out as good as it would if you had drawn it with patience. Another way that it helps the students being patient is that they also sometimes might have to redraw it if the drawing does not come out as good as they thought it would, and that requires patience, especially if make a mistake when you are about to finish it. And also, when they are working in groups they might have to explain for the rest of the group what are their ideas and how they want to do the project, which also requires patience.

The second way art would be important to students is by making them more creative. When you are making art you have to be creative and think a lot. Being creative wouldn't only help them at school, it would also help their future. For example, if the student dream about their future, then it would help them to think more and be creative about what they want to do. Being creative would help them in several ways.

And lastly, art would help them be focused. When you are drawing you have to focus on what you are doing. If you lose the smallest bit of focus, you can make a mistake and might have to do everything again. Being a more focused person would also help them in life. And also, they woul need to focus in the directions when doing their work.

People who are motivated all the time tend to rich a 99% of their goals easily at school or Colleges. As they know being focus is the key to succeed in life. But those who has never tried are the ones to come last , because they do not have enough motivation or self-confidence to do it.

In some cases people are reponsible for their own motivation in life and what'd help them to be successful it is to take good decison.

There are so many opportunities out there, that will make us to be better and what we don't have to do is to make mistakes that will lead us to bad life style. Because later on we won't have second chance to prove our skills and be someone important to admire.

Although people who has a positive attitude are trustful, smart, and kind etc. Even they could help people to reach their dreams. But not always people have the same motivation or satisfaction to stand up and fight for what should be helpful and worthy. Most people tend to give up, because they think it's complicated or hard to get it. But if they do not put a bit of effort to make it won't happened. The success of a person is being dedicated all the time and no matter how hard it's going to be. But they will always give their lives to make it real and that's when they realized that all the effort was for a good reason to be on where they are now.

Those who keeps a positive attitude are the ones to inspire other people by writing books, quotes, poems, etc. People look at them as a way to motivate themselves and believe they can do the same to reach their goals. Sometimes people apply their concepts as how to be successful in life and what it is required to the success of school. People just have to be apassionate for things they love to do in their daily life and the opportunity to prove they are better. Even they will shine like a pearl for the effort and work ethic. They used to give to be positionated far way from others like one of the success person ever seen before.

School, Grades, Homework are important to the success in life.

1146,58EF6CAF956B,"Do you want to know the reason why it is important to have someone who can share wisdom and experience with you? Well, I know there are a lot of reason. The benefit of having someone who shared wisdom and experience with you is that, people will show new things, you will get an opportunity to learn new things, and you won't feel like you are the only one who is experiencing this.

When my friend shared how she overcome being alone, because she couldn't speak English well, I realize that I can overcome being alone too. It was hard for me to talk with the other kids, because I was afraid that they will laugh at me, because I couldn't speak well, and then my friend says ""try to talk with them, otherwise you won't be able to speak with them,"". After that, she told me If I want to communicate, I need to be confident. Like that, She shared her experience.

The another benefit is that you can learn new things from the person who shared their wisdom to you. When they tell you about their experience, you will gain strength from it and you won't be afraid to do new things. When the people who tell you about their experience see you doing new things, they will support you, so that your experience will be memorable.

There are times when you feel like you are the only one who is experiencing this, but when someone tells you about their story, you will feel that you are not the only one who is feeling like this. When they shared their story, you will gain an opportunity to make new friend. You two will share your feeling about the experience and become closer. On the other hand, the funny and the sad stories will make you two have fun while you talk.

Since you know that there are a lot of reasons to share your experience, I wish you could use them to share your wisdom in the future. Don't you think it is the time for you to seek and ask other people's experience?                  ",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,3.8,2
3572,F1A4167422E2,"I disagree with the fact that the school board wants to add an extra hour and a half to each school day. I disagree because many students might have something to do when they come out of school,they are also going to have to get used to a whole new schedule,and they might not have enough time to study or do their homework at home.

After school many students might have something to do or attend. For example,students might have to attend a club, take care of one of their younger siblings, or maybe they have a job after school. If the school board adds another hour and half to a school day these students might have to miss the activity that they have or might have to change what they do. This is bad but what is even worse if having to get used to a whole new school day routine.

They will need to get used to a different schedule or routine. Students will have to get used to much more longer classes and having to leave at a later time. Like I mention in my other paragraph sometimes students have things to do out of school,so they might have to change everything so that they will be able to attend or do what they need to do after school,For example,if they have a job they might have to change their job schedule so that they won't be late. This leads me to my other reason about not having time to do their work at home.

Students might not have to time to study or do their homework at home. Think about it. By the time that students get home,eat,relax,and do anything else they do when they get home,they might end up starting their homework at a really late time. What if they have to study for a test,by the time they start studying they might only have an hour to do it. I know some people might say to their school work before anything else,but what if the student is not able to do their work right away.

In conclusion The school board shouldn't add an extra hour and a half to each school. Although, many people might think that it is a good idea to have extended school hours. It would save a lot of time and work to just leave the school hours like they already are. And,their wouldn't be a reason to add an hour and half because students get a most of their work done in the amount of time they give them in the school day.     ",4.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.9,2
2991,D684AE8A9418,"Many people are going say that we can be our self, but even though we can be as we want in certain things, our character is formed by influences beyond our control because we tend to try to fit in society, we fear making mistakes, and we try to be like someone we admire.

As humans we tend to try to fit in society; we like to feel liked by the people around us, so we act different than we actually are. The feeling of being liked by society in most cases makes us feel pride and self confidence, which is fine but makes a line between being our self and being influenced. Fitting in a society might be hard for some people,even frustrating, but people still are willing to do it so we can not be seen as different. trying to fit in a society might be the biggest reason why we do not act as we want and tend to act as everyone else in front of other people,because we fear that if society categorize us different then society is going to dislike us,however, there is some people that are careless of what people say about them. There is always someone that will not care at all of what people say about them which is good,but, there is always a time where they cared or will care about it. It is part of being a human that we care about what society says because we do not want be seen as someone different that can not fit. For example, students in schools dress as the trend is, so they can fit in society,even when they grow they will care how they look.

The fear of making mistakes influences part of our character. We fear that making mistakes will make us imperfect or not good at something, therefore, we think that if we are not perfect we are a failure,the fear of making mistakes is what makes us human, and that is a gigantic influence to us and we can not control it but makes people stronger and, help us to develop a character that will represent us in the future. we fear many different things in life for example,our appearance, if we think our appearance is not as we want, we get insecure in many different ways but, it is a huge help in the development of our own character because we learn from those mistakes. Being insecure is a huge obstacle and mistake for people to get to choose their own character, because it does not let us decide for what we really want,therefore people should learn from them which it will hopefully help people to develop a better character. Many people find themselves as insecure because of the fact that people might dislike them. Scientist have said that having the fear of making mistakes will make it harder for people to achieve their most wanted goals in life. We all as humans make mistakes, therefore we can not or it is harder for us to find our own character by our own self.

As humans we all have at least someone that we admire a lot,and we see them as a person we should imitate so we can be even a bit as them. Imitating someone in any way will make our self to struggle when trying to develop our own character because we are thinking of how someone else would think. Imitating someone else that has had such a great impact in life might be good for your self and you might achieve your goal because that person did. Even though our character is formed by influences of other we admire we also have to have our own character into it, so we can feel the pride of achieving a goal that has had our effort in to it. Having a bit of your own character into what you do is important too because it is not a full imitation of what someone else did. Many famous es have said that they also had followed someone else's steps to get where they are, so being influenced by the people you admire might help the people a lot to achieve their goals as it did with the famous people,and they also said that the people they admired a lot was the one helped them to find themselves, because if it was not for them they would have probably the same as they were before being famous.

In conclusion, we can decide how we want to be but that does not remove the fact that our character is mostly formed of influences that we can not control because we tend to try to fit in society,we fear making mistakes, and we try to be like someone we admire a lot. People are going to find themselves mostly from experiences and influences that they can not control,however you should have some of your own character to do things so when you achieve something important you feel better about yourself, but we,the people tend to act different so people like us and it is something inevitable,either control in life. As humans we dont like to be categorized as different and our main goal in a big percentage of people in the world is to fit in society and that is something that can not be controlled, but it helps us a lot to find our self afterwards and form our character at the end.",4.0,4.5,4.5,5.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,2
93,06F5F6A09DC6,"More than one person's advice

Have you ever wondered or questioned yourself why do you have to ask more than one person's for advice? Yep you heard me. People from all around the world ask advice about anything. That could be video games, schools, and even Life. Obviously, there are many other things to ask advice. It's kind of asking for help, you can say. People incuding kids, teens, and even adults are asking advice that could help them in the furture, you guys even might have connections, and more than one person. More than one is better than just asking for one person's advice.

Having connections

The people you ask for advice were kids too just like you and they possibly ran into what you are stuck or struggling at right now. I recommand you to ask adults more than anyone else. That's either with struggles at school, home, family members, or even life. I almost forgot to include decisions because small decisions can eventually become big decisions. I recommand you to ask adults more than anyone else. I mean you can ask seniors but they most likely will forget everything since they were kids. The worst thing you can do is asking someone young even a 18 year old adult because you never know what happened in them. Trust and worthy friends you can ask but friends that you just say hi to once a day or even a week wouldn't be so great.

Help in the future

Advices not just help from the presents but in the future as well. According to my calculations you could use that advice over and over again. For example, let's say you didn't know where you put a comma in a sentence, therefore, you used a person's advice and it was to put a and where ever you were going to put the comma at. You can also use it to help your kids and even grandsons if you still remember.

More than one person's advice

Last but not least, why more than one person's advice you ask. One advice can help and even solve whatever you have in mind but you actually want to check if they were right. You probably want to gather the information and rethink it. Everyone in my opinion should at most ask two people for advice just to make sure. First person person wasn't being that specific enough so you decide to go to another person. If they haven't been specific enough then just go to another person. I mean how hard is that? Especially kids since they have just started growing up and will soon become young adults.

Everybody should be struggling something in a certain time of life that they ask for advice. Don't be shy for asking advice and you believe in yourself that you are a brave and confedent man that doesn't need help. Because really you will be a better one for asking advice. Therefore, the reason that we ask advice is to become someone better each day by taking that advice.",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,3.9,2

This city has been loved by almost everyone, and a lot of people talk about the beauty it has.

Generic_City is one of the most intriguing places in the world, and that is another reason I would love to go there. I would love to visit this place because of its friendly people, its cheerful environment, and its delicious food. Generic_City has been one of the most popular places that people visit and enjoy their time in. If I ever have the chance to go to Generic_City, I would love to see the Generic_City in real life, because it's the site nobody wants to miss when they visit this city. Even looking at its pictures makes people get lost in their thoughts because of the marvelous view.

Once I arrive, I would love to visit some family members I have in that place, and have fun with them. I have known a lot people who have visited Generic_City and told me about their experiences.

Most workers may ask that and will be furious with technology because of the fact that they will have less work and probably less hours of work, since technology is taking over their jobs. it could also be said that technology could be taking over some jobs that require less work, which could be bad for the job environment because that means less job opportunities for people.

First, it could be rude to the staff that work their because of less human communication. How is it rude? Well think of it like this: someone is better than you at your job and you wanna be better, but you cant because the person you're going up against is a computer and knows mostly anything and everything on what to do in those situations. Most people may have to face the fact that you can't do anything about technology.

Second, The limitation of human contact due to the use of technology will have negative effects on peoples lives because of the fact that technology will help most people in some cases, but most people wouldn't appreciate the help from technology because it could be taking over their jobs and have less human contact with others. But the fact is people should appreciate technology because of what they're providing. Most people may not see it that way or feel like its helping them.

In conclusion, I believe with the reasons I have provided that technology will have a negative effect because of the way they're taking over most jobs and seeking happiness to people that enjoy it.

417,1FB89CF59E5B,"Influence can be divided in words, actions, and motivation. Words can give a individual influence. Actions can give a example of what to do, when to do it, and/or how to do it. Motivation has a impact in people's life that can demonstrate influence to others. Some people say that giving a example is the only way to demonstrate influence. By analyzing each paragraph the reader will have a summery about how a example is not the only way to influence people.

Word can give a excellent influence. Many people tend to hear what other influences say. For example a YouTuber called Alpha M teaches young men, or older men to be more succefull. If Alpha M does not have his charismatic character to talk, then many of his public would not listen to what he says. Words can dictate influence if the person knows what is he or she saying. Not only words is a key, but is a fundamental key.

Action is a important key to demonstrate influence in peoples life. Actions tell in a non verbal way how to do certain things in life. For example, Messi, a really famous soccer player, has played soccer since he was 9 years old. His talent has influence many people to be better in sports, and to be better in life. If Leonel Messi did not had the talent to play soccer, then his influence would be less or non. Actions can tell what to do, when to do it, and/or, how to do it. By analyzing actions the reader can tell that actions is a important key, but motivation can give influence to.

Motivation can do many things for influence. It demonstrates character, responsibility, and success and thats what people most want to follow, more in this days. Generic_Name, a police officer, has demonstrated a lot of responsibility in many times. He has been rewarded many times because of his excellent work, and his motivation. His motivation has influenced many people to obey the laws, and to be better in society. If Generic_Name's motivation was not good, then many people would not obey the laws. Motivation can make millions of people to be influenced by one person. Motivation is a key, but some people say something else.

Some people say that giving a example to society is the only way to influence people. Words, actions, and motivation can give a person influence to follow them or motivate them to do something. By giving a example the person is only influencing people in one way. In particular, a teacher from Generic_school tells students to not use their cellphones during class period, even though he gives the example of not using his cellphone, many students still use their device. If the teacher had giving the students the words, actions, and motivation, then the students would be influenced by the teacher's order. Giving a example is part of influencing others.

After reading each paragraph, the reader can have a conclusion that a example is not the only way to influence others in society. A individual's influence can be based by words . What to do, when to do it, and/or how to do it can give example of actions, which gives influence. A individuals motivation can demonstrate influence to others and have a impact in people's life. Some people say that to demonstrate influence, the only thing to do is by giving a example. Words, actions, and motivation are three key factors that can give a person many influence around the world.

Students should not be aloud to use their phones during class because students would pay more attention to their phones than their teachers.

Some teachers would rather take their students to the library or to a computer lab to use the computers to do assignments, instead of letting them use their phones because students would not get their work done. For example in my school we used to have the school WIFI on our phones but that only made us get distracted so my school decided to take down the WIFI from our phones, this year we were given chromebooks so we can do our class works in class without having to go to the library or a computer lab. We can take our chromebooks in any class to do our assignments and it's made a huge impact on every student because now no one is ever on their phones, and we pay more attention to our teachers.

By letting students use their cell phones during class will increase the chances for them to get distracted, for example one day my english teacher gave us a reaserch paper and told us that we could use our cell phones to search up important documents, while we were doing our work one of my classmates' phone went off because she got a snapchat notification and everyone got distracted, the next day everyone was using their phones in class and no one was doing the work that we were assigned to do. Students should not be aloud to use their phones during class because it will not benefit them, this would be a distraction to not only students but teachers as well.

If schools let students use their phones there also will be a higher chance that students' grades will drop, and a lot of parents would not be pleased. My parents would get extremely mad if my school let us use our cell phones during class because they know I would easily get distracted, if we were aloud to use our phones the whole school would be a disaster. Teachers would not be happy with the idea of letting students use their phones, because every teacher wants the whole class' attention on them not their cellular devices. Some students and schools might think that letting students use their phones would be a great idea because it could probably benefit those students who might not have a computer at home, and maybe letting them use their cell phones during class to do their assigments would help them, but that doesn't mean that every student has to use their phones too.

Schools should not let students use their phones for educational purposes because it would be a big distraction for students and teachers.

People do anything on phones, but it has negative things to using them a lot: dating people through text, and less communication in real life and more over text. While most people believe that technology has positive effects in reality, it is mostly a negative effect.

Technology is not a good thing in certain situations. It is better to get to know people in person rather than social media or anything. No one knows who someone is until they meet them in person because some people lie to make someone like them. Technology can hurt people in different ways: physical, emotional, or any other way.

1652,7D955FAD0C73,"Likewise, many people belive that "" Determine never to be idle ... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"". By all means that by being idle you wont get much done, but if active can get a lot of more stuff done. Others belive that by being idle, you can still get anything done as much as a person that is consistently active. I strongly agree that by being active will get more tasks complete and it will be less difficult. By always having something to do, your showing everyone your character and your morals. Inactivity and idleness is not good because by not having anything to do you wont learn as much as a person that has to do majority of time. Actively participator have better improved skills then those who dont do anything.

Firstly, being active is the best goal a mind set can have. It will be less likely for one to not complete a task or struggle with a task if is idle. Always doing something no matter if you have nothing to do, shows a lot about someones motivation and actions. Especially in a work place, if your boss sees you doing nothing while there being things to do, hes going to think your inactive. By showing everyone you always have something to do, your showing them that you are capable of doing anything. Theres no task to difficult or no job to big for you to complete because you are already used of always doing something in your everyday life and while being idle from the task isnt part of your expectation or motives. If you think of always being occupied and being successful it practically the same concept just because getting task done is like you doing anything you are asked to do and being successful is like achieving your goals.

Secondly, Idle and inactivity serves a purpose when you are a 100 percent sure you can do anything when asked to. For example my dad once told me, why are you always playing video games and that why dont i go and play outside with my friends. What i told him was that i did not want to and he told me that my actions show a lot about who i am. After that he signed me up for a youth soccer team, that i played being a defender. Although i wasnt good, i started trying my best and being active with the team. Later that day my coach was talking to my dad and telling him how i was participating and doing everything he told me to do. What he also had suggested to my dad was if he can move me up to a left forward because of all the hard work and commitment i had done for the pass warm ups and practice games.

Therefore, people that are always participating you will see improvement in grades, work ethic and body structure. People that always are doing something productive in there everyday life have good grades because they are used of finishing all their work, rather then the student that doesnt do anything and idled from the class. Humans that are always active rather than being idle and isolated have a better attitude and work experience. Going to the Gym doesnt only show that you have an excellent daily routine but you are person that has a goal to complete each and every day. Keeping your self occupied thew out any circumstance is a good skill and shows that you are not inactive and that nothing is excluding you from doing anything you have to do.

In conclusion, do you think always having something to do all the time shows who you really are? Participating shows a lot about a person goals and achievements. Inactive people show their lack of interest and the type of attitude shown. While a person that is consistently doing things and keeping there self occupied and does not tend to complain about what they are ever asked to do. Always doing stuff will make you want to complete more each and every time.",4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.7,2
1613,7AC357DAA5D7,"Its been said that a positive attitude is key to success in life. I agree, I think its nessasary to have a positive attitude in your everyday life , in your work place, in your ""time of need."" those are the most important times you will need to show your best.

First , I think its important to have a positive attitude in your everyday life because, of the stress that goes on. No one will understand how you feel other than you. If you stay in the mindset of "" i cant do this,"" ""this is too hard."" You will never see yourself prosper and grow. How can you have the biggest expectations in life when you are so dull and negative. To advance you need to be aware that everything is going to be okay, be reminded of that.

Secondly, your work place always has to stay positive. This is the place you go to work in , this is a place you try to distract yourself from the rest of the world. If you set your self to a person who feels as if they cant do anything then you will never reach that promotion youve been waiting for. If you set your self as the person who puts too much on themselves, you will never see growth. You can do the impossible it will just be up to you to change your circle.

In conclusion, being positive in many ways will always change your mindset . Positive attitudes are key to a better future and for the best success in your life. ",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.8,2
3018,D84024335230,"People are love challenges and learn new languages. There are 67 languages have spoken in the world, 8.9% of us speak Vietnamese. Vietnamese is on top 10 hardest language has spoken. My skill is can speak Vietnamese fluently. I can do a lot of things with Vietnamese, such as translate English to Vietnamese, teach my friends how to speak Vietnamese and to communicate with others Vietnamese.

I can speak both Vietnamese and English at the same time, so that's mean I could translate from English to Vietnamese or even Vietnamese to English. Don't you think it would be helpful for your parents when you 're on a family vacation. That is my main job whenever I go out with my mom, because she doesn't speak English or able to understand it.

My friends are love Vietnamese, they always convince me to teach them this amazing language. When I come to my class my friend start saying ""Xin Chao"" it means ""Hello"" in English, I'm so glad that they love and want to learn it. I had a friend who is American, I taught him how to speak Vietnamese, and now he can speak Vietnamese like his home language.

However it would be helpful if you are in Vietnam or a place where the most Vietnamese people lives, you could ask them in Vietnamese when you need help( I bet if you are from a foreign country and you can speak Vietnamese, they will think you're super cool). I remember that one time, I had a family reunion and I went to Vietnam. Then I was lost, I tried yell ""Help me, I lost, I can't find my parent"", but they couldn't understand what I was said, luckily I can speak Vietnamese, I asked them where is the police station so I could find my parents.

Overall, Vietnamese is the perfect language to learn if you want to challenge yourself. It would help you a lot if you want to visit Vietnam one day.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.6,2
2310,AC3111702C95,"First impressions are always important and can really effect how you are looked at but they are not impossible to change. They impact whether you get the job, make that friend or even if you get service if you are somewhere. I believe that first impressions are not impossible to change, they are hard but not impossible. Firstly, because someone could always forget, people can change, and you could receive a second chance to redeem yourself.

I have met people a second time that either I had a bad first impression with or they did and we forgot all about it. When you forget about somebody, the first impression with obviously not matter. You will forgive and forget. Also when I say the word ""forget,"" I do not mean completely lose all knowledge of the other person, but I mean maybe you did not care or maybe the first impression was not terrible that it was easy to block from your memory.

I have changed and many people in my life have also changed. Your first impression or somebody else's first impression might change if you meet them again in five to ten years. Over a period of time if let's say somebody who had a bad job interview wants to change and really wants the job, they will change and they will ask for another opportunity. Even if you have a bad encounter with someone the five times you have met them, your opinion about them will change with just one good impression. People change and when they do, so do impressions.

Second chances are also very important with impressions. Redeeming themselves is something a lot of people tend to do. Chances are not hard to ask for, and when making it up to somebody for a bad impression, you need to make it count. I have asked several people for second chances to redeem myself for bad impressions and now, we are friends. When I first applied to my first job, I was late to my interview and that is why I did not get the job. Then I asked my boss for a second chance, he gave it to me and now I have an amazing job.

In conclusion, no, first impressions are not impossible to change because there is forgetful people, people change and second chances exist. It is not hard to be on your best behavior or to be well dressed when meeting someone new, especially if they are of higher authority. First impressions are not impossible but are difficult to change, that is why it is good to try and make a good first impression to save you from trouble.",4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.2,2
724,380164B1BAB5,"Some high school districts offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. I think this is a bad Idea because students should be required to be in school eight hours everyday. Allowing these students to take online courses they lack teaching and intructions in a classroom, evening school is a poor idea, and elective courses should be required to boost their gpa. Letting students to have these options they might not enjoy school as they should.

In other words, I think students should and must be placed in a classroom. Take an example physical education and health is a required course for graduation. However, how can you allow a student to take a course like that online and expect he or she to learn. I am not saying it impossible; I think they should be taught. A course like this deserve to be in a gym somewhere so students can interact with one another. Also, most students do not comprehend well through a screen and this might affect their way of learning.

Also, I think evening school is a bad idea because students need that eight hour of sleep every night. Giving them these options it could lead to bigger problems. This could ruin he or she lifestyles because they have to be willing to get up at night to attend school. Abscences could rise up because the students could be tired. When they have this option parents might not be able to take them to school if they live far and this could lead to safety issues.

In conclusion, school districts should insist the traditional four years of high school. When they have an extra year, they could use it to boost their grades. Having elective courses could help the students dramatically. Most students tend to score low in one class then others. Letting students take elective courses it could boost their gpa. Students should be placed in a classroom with everybody else and it would give them the opportunity learn and interact with each other.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.1,2
2772,CB34AD33CAEB,"Playing an instrument is fun because it can a hobby for the people who are just starting. For example, A piano is used for many types of music. Such as Smooth jazz, Rock, Orchestra, Rap and much more. Pianos requires a great amount of practice and knowing all the keys to create a good music at a play with the audience amused. Professional piano players gets most people's attention by knowing the right keys for the music that the piano players are playing. In addition, There are many tutorials of how to play the piano and learning the right key on social media to begin or improve your piano skills, due to technology. As a result, Pianos has been used frequently in the 1960's for music and people still listen to it everyday in the radio in their automobile. But sometimes Smooth jazz with a piano in the background is played at a cafe and restaurants to relief the stress that people are having in their personal lives. But there are way more instruments than just the piano.

A saxophone is fun to use and its kind of similar to a piano according to the similarity of what music type the instrument is used on, except for rock, rap, and maybe orchestra. The saxophone is famously known by smooth jazz, jazz, and night jazz and night jazz are commonly used in New York cafes at night and other states. Next, the saxophone is similar to a trumpet, trombone, and tuba by blowing on the top part of the saxophone and at the same time using your both of your hands to make a rhythm. However, an electric piano has more than 20 buttons of instruments to choose from. It has guitar, trumpet, flute, clarinet, and even a saxophone for a different sound for the keys just for the people who want to change their style. In addition, Saxophones can be taught in music class in middle school, high school, or just a music school in general. It takes a couple of years to practice for beginners or couple of months to practice a new music for experts. But if you master a saxophone, thats where the fun part starts. You can create relaxing jazz instrumentals for people to listen to for meditation and stress relieving. And you can also be well known for doing those kinds of stuff. But, there is a last instrument that is really famous and also really fun to use.

There are different types of guitars to choose from dealing with music. The acoustic guitar is one of the most calm sounding guitars in the world because it is used to make sad music and also relaxing. This guitar is fun to use by learning how to know which strings you should use first in order to make a good song or music with a acoustic guitar in the background. Next, the distorted guitar is mostly well known by rock and heavy metal. These guitars need to be plugged on an amplifier for it to work and they are loud. But thats what heavy metal fans like such as Intensity. The clean guitar is mostly used for country music and soft rock. This is another type of guitar that people really like the rhythm and can listen to it nonstop. These three types of guitars are very different and attracts people's taste of music because some people are different.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.6,2
3744,F90A6181BBCA,"In this world many of us make decisions by ourselves and others seek guidance to make decisions in their life. While some people argue that people should seek guidance to make decisions in their life, but I think it is more beneficial if people make their own decisions because if people make their own decisions they will develop their self confidence and they will become responsible person. Also, if people make their own decisions they will have happier life in the the future.

It's true that by making our own decisions that we will develop our self confidence and become responsible person. If person make decision that decision might be hard, after making the decision the person will develop his or hers self confidence and they will become responsible for the decision that they made. For example, if one person decides to leave his parents house to live by his own, he will be responsible for himself because he decided not to live with his parents no more. This will help him to be responsible person because he has to take care of himself by his own. Another example can be, In school, Students choose their classes for next year by themselves. This will help them to develop their self confidence because they are deciding what is better for them or not by their own. Also, this will help them to decide and have a confidence in what they will major in the future. So, by making our own decisions we can develop our self confidence and become responsible person.

Secondly, It's also true that by making our own decisions we will be happy and have happier life. When people make important decisions by themselves and if they achieve their goal by making this decision they will become happy and they can have happier life. For instance, if one student decided not to go college, instead he wanted to become a soccer player. If the student worked hard and become a professional soccer player he will be happy and will have happier life because he decided to become a professional soccer player by himself instead of going college. Additionally, In school, When I was sophomore, I was choosing classes for next year and I decided to take classes that I thought that are important for me and that can help me for college. Then when I take the classes this year I was very happy of my decision because this classes helped me a lot. So, people should make their own decision because they will be happy and have happier life by the decision they made.

On the other hand, some people argue that people should seek guidance to make decisions in their life because it helps them not to make wrong decisions, but I think that is wrong because if you always seek guidance to make decision in your life the decision that you made may not satisfy you in your future life. For example, if your parents advice you to make decision to become a doctor and if you made a decision to be a doctor by listening your parents ,in the future you might have bad life because being a doctor might not be part of your life. Also, you will experience difficulties in your life because your decision is influenced by others. So, people should make their own decision because it helps them to become better self confident person. By making our own decision we can gain a lot in our life.

Finally, people should make their own decision because it will help them to develop their self confidence and to become a better person by being responsible. Also, by making their own decision they will have a better life in the future. People should make their own decision to become better person by achieving their goals. Additionally, peoples have to make a decision by themselves because they can gain a lot in their life.                ",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.3,2

Summer vacations should don't be change because students want to go to others countries, spend time with their friends and family, and they don't want to be worry about school.

When the students are in summer vacations they planning to go and visit others countries. They want to go to visit their family that live in other country or they only want to go and meet new places. If the educators change the summer vacations to only 3-4 weeks the students will not have much time to visit the places that they want to go. Nevertheless, not all the students want to go to others contries and stay a long time, there some prefer stay in home but they spend the summer time doing what they like to do.

The students like to spend time doing things that they like to do in summer vacations; for example, they want to spend sometime with their family and friends and make memories together. Also they want to work to make money, play video games, play some sports, or go to a summer camp. Meanwhile, others students don't want to go outside because it's so hot or they don't like be under the sun but they also don't want to go to school.

Students like summer vacations because they can make a lots of things that they can't do when they are in school. For example, if they want to go to a party or to a friend's house and can back to their houses until the morning or if they want to look TV all the day they can do it. In addition, they are happy to have a long summer vacation because they are not worry about homewoork or projects, they don't have to get up early to go to school, or study for a test. A long summer break can affect the memory of the students and they can forget somethings that they learn in school; however, some students like to review their notes and it's not so long the summer break. Furthmore, the students don't forget everything that they had learn and take a break of something so difficult and important like school is good.

In conclusion, a long summer break is something good that help the students to relax and come back the next school year with a big smile and ready to learn new things. The students like more a long than a short summer break because they can do more things that they like. The students like summer more than winter because in winter is cold and there not many things to do. Instead, in summer is hot and there are so much things to do.

442,2157AE4AFAA6,"I agree that people make their own decisions to learn about life, and be more independent. Sometimes it is difficult to follow advices, but that can make us a better person every day. As an illustration, every people comit defeats, yet that can teach us to be more stronger people,and never give up. People will grow only if they start being independents, trying new things, and learn to be better by they own self.

By being more independently, people will learn how to take their own decisions. People can start taking their own decisions when they do not live with their parents anymore. As an illustration, they can find a good work, pay their own things, and having the capacity to make their owns decisions. Besides, people have to have more responsability; in order to take a decision because that can affect ourselves. However, that can makes us more stronger, and be more prepared in life.

Trying new experiences can also, teach us to be more independently, and learn about others people experiences in taking a decision. In fact, we can ask for advices to our parents or in someone that we trust because they will tell us what is good or what is bad for us. Additionally, sometimes there is people that the only thing that they do is judge us for the decision that we take, but that does mean that we are a bad person. We can propose to ourselves everything, and we should never get down.

Besides, we always can try to be a better person, and think more about every decision that we choose.

3333,E70DD00622DB,"From my personal experience back in middle school, I had to use technology for many different reasons. One of the reasons were for research purposes. I was able to use technology as a tool to provide information on my assignments and projects. So far technology has made a positive effect in my life not only in school but in real life. Technology has helped me accomplish and complete many difficult task in life. I believe that technology has made a positive effect on people's lives; consequently, it makes peoples lives a lot easier and convenient.

One reason that technology has a positive effect on people is that they are able to study without having to go out on a library and pay for books or a tutor to teach them. For example, people who are disabled or unable to travel out of their houses are able to go online and research for books and look for a site to teach them what they need to learn. The availability to go online and research for information also helps students who are too busy to go outside and ask others for help. Many schools started providing laptops and iPad's to students who are unable to connect online. Schools are using these electronics because they provide an easier way to help student learn and complete work.

Technology can also help people do many other things online other than researching for information.

Furthermore, technology may also be used as a way to shop whatever and whenever. For example, eBay and amazon is an online shopping website for many things such as: furniture, clothes, food, and many other reliable things. This has made it a lot easier for people to purchase items that they want at any time. Online shopping helps a lot of people who are looking for items that cannot be found in local stores. For example, many custom equipment's and items can only be found online and in places that may not even be located in your place. Not only does technology may be use as an online tool, it may also used as a way to communicate to others in the world.

Lastly, communication has been a major part of the world; in addition, technology has been one of their ways to communicate. For example, our military has improved a lot throughout the years due to the inventions of many technologies. Technologies such as: cellular devices, radar, satellite and many other communicating tools has helped us win wars and accomplish many things around the world. Another reason why technology has had a positive effect on people is that they use it for emergency purposes. For example, if an adult needs to call out of work for the day because of family problems, he may use his cellular device to call and inform his supervisor about it.

Many people say that technology is a way to showcase yourself as a lazy person and I disagree with that. I believe that technology allowed many people to accomplish and complete many task. Technology is not only important to the civilians who are either students or adults who are working in the industry, but it is also important for the military who are using these tools to provide protection to our country and keep our people safe. In conclusion, technology has had a positive effect on people's lives and that is due to many reasons such as online researching, online shopping, and wide spread communication.

3209,E0E060143B79,"Do you think failure lead you to do better? In this paper i will argue about never losing enthusiasm by falling and falling. Failure should be just another way to do better, because you try until you get it right, when you fail; failure lead you to success in life. Also, enthusiasm and try is the key to success.

First of all, when you try until you get it right, sometimes you get really frustrated. For example; in freshman year i remember that i couldn't actually get good grades in my algebra class, i remember that i try and try my harder to get good grades. I even stayed after school, I was doing my homework, i was watching videos from my teacher. However, i was still getting bad grades in my class but i keep trying and i finally become a success in the class.

Secondly, when you fail; failure lead you to success in life. When you are working on a project or you are working on a personal goal sometimes thing doesn't actually goes the way you had planted. For example; if you are trying to solve a mathematics problem but you never get the solution you're supposed to get. Although, you keep trying and you always fail, you actually learning from it. However, by keep trying your best you actually getting experience from your failure and that helps you to success later in life.

Finally, enthusiasm and trying is the key to success. For example; when you want to achieve something but you fail, each time you're losing enthusiasm because you think that you can not do it, but if you keep trying and trying their will be a time that you will going to success and you would said that you try your best and never lost enthusiasm for your goal.

In conclusion, some people said that failure doesn't lead you to success, but they wrong because the more you fail, the more you try, and when you get it right, it will be a completely success for you. Going failure to failure led you to a good way to do better in life because the harder you try the better you do to success. In the future never stop trying without losing enthusiasm because enthusiasm is the key of your success.",3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.6,2
2453,B6B85CE5C8F5,"When it comes to trying to be someone, is it better to improvise or follow the script all the time?

Everyone needs to have their own individuality and be original instead of trying to be something else because that way you learn more about yourself. Also, you are acknowledging different methods about how to be better than yourself. And one of the most important things, you could make a good influence in someone else's life and teach him/her how to find their path in their own way. No matter what happens, you always have to follow yourself.

When you learn more about yourself it means that you do not just learn things that you already know about yourself, you also learn new things that you did not know about yourself. For example, one day you are going to the basement of your house which is really big and put some good music. While you are listening to your favorite songs from your playlist, you are dancing according to the tempo and doing the dancing moves that you usually do. After dancing for a long while, suddenly you let the music take control over you and you make a back flip without practicing it before. You are very surprised because you did something that you did not know you could do and after that, you keep practicing that move and perfectioning it and it comes out natural. That is how you learn more about yourself.

You are acknowledging different methods to be better than yourself. This means you will do whatever is right in order to become a better person. For example, Robert Downey Jr used to have a terrible life by consuming drugs and other things that got him in trouble with the law. He even went to court for all the messy things he did. After a long time taking bad decisions, he finally decided to make things better for the people who cares about him and specially for him. It took him over 5 years for him to get back on his feet; with his own effort and the support from his family and friends, he started to make a good difference for the world. Right now, Robert is one the best actors in Hollywood, he has an excellent life with his wife and kids on his side, and is a great influence for millions of people. That is how you acknowledge different methods to be better that yourself.

Some people say that you are copying someone else when you try to be yourself. However, they are wrong because you actually are listening to those tips that you have heard and following them under your own perspective. That way you are definitely writing your own script but at the same time, giving the deserved credit to the person who gave you those tips. For instance, when you are trying to get a girl that you met in a party but you have no idea of what to do in order to get her attention. You ask your friend for some advice to accomplish your goal so you do not go through a bad experience. He tells you what to do exactly and shows you with some women at the party and now you have some ideas of what you can do. So before you reach out to that girl, your friend tells you ""be yourself all the time"" and you get the courage to talk to her. After following those examples in your own way, the girl started to have deep feelings for you and everything worked out a lot well and make some influence to some of your friends who need that kind of help. That is how you follow your own script with your own terms.

In conclusion, it is very important that you have be yourself all the time because it shows that you do not need somebody in order to be somebody. You learn about yourself so you can get to know your own person more than you can know about an anime character. You acknowledge new ways to become better than yourself like if you were in a videogame, you are going to the next level slowly. You make a good influence by doing things as right as possible and you give people some benefits out of it.

When you give someone advice, on what not to do or what to do, they won't take you serious because you're not following your own advice. They'll see you as if you're playing around if you do the opposite of what you told them. That's why a lot of people say ""Actions speak louder than words"". There's a difference on saying things, and actually doing them.

Therefore, there are people who knows you, and want to be like you. You never know if they can come up to you, out of nowhere and ask for opinions and advice. You can't just say anything, you can say something you do, and something you follow. Keep in mind that there's a lot of things people see in you. How you behave can change the way they see you too.

Primarily technology's goal is to make certain tasks easier, not to make us anti-social or make us obese. In my opinion technology has a great potential, and we are not using it to the full potential, we are supposed to use it to make simple task easier, but people are spoiling this potential by instead of making our own food we now order it from a restaurant which is ten times unhealthier. Another thing that is a huge problem is people building their life around technology, if they lose that technology they think they'll die. Everyone uses social apps on their phone, and that's a huge issue because that is one of the main reasons of people choosing social media over having conversations face to face.

Secondly, technology has it's pros as it has it's cons. One of the main advantages of technology is minimizing the waste of time in simple daily life tasks. For example, before technology people used to communicate with mails which took a long time to arrive at the designated place, however currently you can shorten that whole process to only a minute or two. Also with technology we can make waste free houses, cars, planes, and many other things by making them operate with electricity rather than fossil fuels which harms our planet. We can harvest electrical energy by solar panels, wind turbines, hydroelectric turbines. Another great thing about harvesting electrical energy is that they are infinite unless a disaster happens and suddenly all our water vaporizes or the sun gets blocked or the wind stops blowing. Until disasters like those happens we are good to go with waste free energy.

Third of all I think that technology is a great invention for the human kind. Although it has multiple harmful effects for people, the way to cure those are as easy. If we stop building our life around social media or technology, and keep technology as just a secondary communication device. Technology has come a far way from where it started. Once it was used just to power a light bulb, now its used to power our cars, houses, phones, cities, everything you see that is human built has some sort of technology in it.

Finally all these great inventions, all of these dazzling things took our attention and isolated us from the others. I think that technology is a brilliant invention but also it is a very harmful one for our social life. Human is a social creature by it's nature, if something blocks the socializing part of being human it will end badly. If someone tries to change a creature's nature it will try to avoid it, for thousands of years it has evolved to its current state, and now we are trying to change it... All Im trying to point out is technology is a beneficial element of our life but social-life is not one of them.                                                  ",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.9,2

Although some people say the use of technology had positive effect on people because It improve efficiency of people's life, actually in my opinion I think the use of technology had negative effects on people because It reduce people's communication to each other and make people more loneliness.

some people say the use of technology had positive effect on people because It improve efficiency of people's life. Our life pace very fast. So, the efficiency is very important. However work and life because time is money. Thus depend this situation technology provide more fast more easily way occupy the primary market. More and more young people don't go outside. they just stay at home because Internet have everything they want.

in my opinion I think the use of technology had negative effects on people because It reduce people's communication to each other. Have a conversation to others is very important part in our life. Some thing you can't learn by Internet and book but you can learn it by take with people. At a family, which member rely technology too much. It will inflict some crack by lest conversation.

in my opinion I think the use of technology had negative effects on people because It make people more loneliness.

Technology has big attraction to us because it is interesting. But also people are easily indulge. People will in to a world for themselves and don't like talk to people face by face. Finally they will be deserted fact life that become a stoic person.

3624,F47F7676912A,"I met a friend online from Generic_City, therefore I went to visit him and learn a lot about his culture. In this paper I will argue about that the use of technology haves a positive effect on peoples lives and human contact. In my opinion technology haves a positive effect on people lives because they can find new jobs, meet new people , and communicate with other people that you are nervous to talk in person.

Having a hard time finding a job? Theres a lot of jobs available online and you can sign up online without going to the store and ask for a job application. If your sick and can't go to work, therefore you can contact your boss online and ask for a day off and avoid getting fired by not coming to work. If you need to talk to your boss and he is not in work you can send him a online message. You can see that technology helps your job to be more easier without having any problems.

Dont you feel bored knowing only about your culture? You can meet people from different culture online and learn more about there style of life. Technology helps you vision other peoples thoughts and opinion from another country. Technology is the glue that helps a lot of people from different culture work together and hate each other less. people can learn how to fix there mistakes by seeing other people online from different cultures instead of fixing it on your own tradition way that may be harder or useless. For example i learn how to fix a car much more easier by following my friend method from Generic_City.

I havent seen my family for six years and only talk to them by sending text messages. Im shy and nervous to communicate with them in person. Technology helps you built that confidence to talk with other people from around the world or people that you care for. It Doesnt matter if you only communicate with them sending only online messages. At least you are expressing your feelings your thoughts and your opinion to your loves one or your friend that you are shy to talk in person.

Some say technology is ruining human contact with other people in person . But they are wrong because technology helps you to meet new people, find a job, and communicate with people that your are nervous to speak with. I hope one day people around the world understands that without technology we wouldnt have the diversity we have in this world today.",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.8,2

I have completed quite a few goals in my life because it was all i would put my focus to. With certain things it takes one of another to be with you through it to help you, Because it would depend on what you need to have done. I've helped lots of people get through on what they needed and sometimes its more of what has to be done.

People always need to help themselves because it would make them better in their life in my opinion. Its good to see people doing well because of the achievements they have decided to complete. lots of amazing opportunities like you could get a good job, A new car, House or just anything that you would want in general. The small things in life could be just done on its own without you or anyone having to do something about it.

So overall many achievements would be done if you are always working hard for it and could be better if you do more than what you're suppose to do. It's great to help yourself in life because you don't know how good it would turn out in the end. There is people that i know that always worked hard for what they wanted in life and got what they needed.

1817,88FD7FAAFA90,"Some school require students to complete summer projects. This is a great idea, and it would be better if the students would be able to pick the topic. One of the reasons is students know what interest them more. Second they would put more effort and time on the project. finally studenst inprove there skills when writing something they enjoy.

To start with, summer projects should be student designed. Students should be able to pick their topic do to they know what interest them and what doesnt. For example, Generic_Name a student at Generic_School was given a project about sea animals. Generic_Name doesnt know nothing about marine animals and has no interest on the project. Therefor, Generic_Name has no idea what to say and its not in his interest. Furthermore, Generic_Name will be in summer break it would be less stressful to talk bout a topic he likes instead of a boring one the teacher would give out. Also the students would put more effort and time to the project.

Secondly, by the student knowing what he likes and his strength they'll aim for that A on the project. Students alfound do poorly on school project due to the topic they were given. For example, Generic_Name was given the topic to right about sports Generic_Name. Generic_Name has never done sports her self so there she has no interest on it. Generic_Name will do the project and get finished on time but, did not put time and effort to do her best. Undoubtedly, students do better on a topic they all feel good about.

Finally the students will enjoy doing the project. Statistics show that when students write about something they like, they tend to improve in both reading and writing skills. For example, Generic_Name was able to right about a topic she likes, therefor, she enjoyed writing and improved her skills in reading and writing. Generic_Name enjoyed doing this project that she added more information about the topic. undauntedly, students summer project should be student designed.

Despite this valid reasons there are does who think teacher should pick the topic. How ever they are wrong. Because students should be able to enjoy writing, and with the prompts the teacher gives out they just get stress out. Unquestibily, summer projects should be studenst desinged.

To close up studenst will gain knolege and enjoy writing. They will aslo do better in the project do to is in there best interest. And finally a summer project should be fun not boring. ",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.6,2

suddenly she cross the final line ; Everyone was screaming from joy. Most teenagers can't participate in any extracurricular activity for different reasons.

For example, in Generic_Name experience was because she had to look after her brothers.

Occasionally teenagers look for ways to spend time doing what they like. In fact, there have been many cases where teenagers use a sport to feel less stress or to spend more time with their friends, for these reason teenagers should be able to participate in extracurricular activities. Recently researches discovered that kids that are more active in their life-style can concentrate more than kids that stay in their houses doing nothing all day, like when

Generic_Name was practicing the sport she start making new friends and loving the progress she was making every day.

Generic_Name parents felt surprise because their daughter was following her dream. Some parents think sports are a waste of time and that you are not going to needed in the future, although its going to help you in the future in many ways . For example, before Generic_Name was in the team of runners she felt tired all the time, but went she start practicing she was more active . Most teenagers don't like sports, as a result of that the principal add more things you can do. Know you can decide what do you want to do after school.

I like the idea for students to participate in an extracurricular activities because students will have an activity to do after school and the will spend more time with there friends. If there is a student that don't have any friends this will help them make friends and learn new things. Teenagers should do at least one sport or participate in other activities for their own good.

817,3F2941C11D95,"By extending the school day two hours, students and teachers will have more advantages to learn and to teach.

I agree to follow this model by extending the school day two hours. There are many reasons of why it will be better and will benefit us as students. One of the reasons is that we will have more time in the weekend to review our notes, homework, and things that we need help with. Another reason is that we will be doing the same forty hours of school even if we will have a four-day school week. It also will benefit teachers by increasing their time to review test or projects made by the students.

Most of the time there are things at school that we do not really understand, and a four-day school week will give us more time to study and review these things at home. We the students have the opportunity to go to school and graduate, but also some of us have obligations and responsibilities. For example in my personal life, I have to work after school everyday. And most of the time when I get home, I feel tired and I just go to sleep, I forget if I have homework or not. Therefore this model will give us more time to work and being less worry about going to school five-day week. We can concentrate at school four days and the other day we can work and do homework or projects when we have to.

Also a four-day school week will benefit us because we will be doing the same forty hours. Therefore our grades and education would not change. And I do not think that is necessary to study all five days, it is not about how many days do you go to school, is about how you take advantages from it. For example if you go to school everyday just to talk with your teammates, is like you were absent. For that reason I agree to extend the two hours of school, that way we can concentrate four days and having in mind that we will have three days to study or to keep learning at home.

Another reason of why I agree to extend the school day, is because it will benefit the teachers also. It will benefit the teachers by giving them more time to review and grade homework, projects or test that students took in the class. It also will give us the opportunity to spend more time with our families and people around us. For example, I work with my father in construction, and I almost do not see him all day until the night. This four-day school week, will give me the opportunity to spend a entire day working with him without being worry about the school for a day. And just like me, there is a lot of people who will be benefit from it.

Finally, school should be extended two hours day, that way we can have more time in the weekend to prepare for tests, teachers will have more time to grade them. And we will have three days to spend with our families.                     ",5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.2,2

One reason, why I love Korea as much is beacuse of the food. The food in Korea is so tasty for example the korean BBQ (Barbeque). Korean BBQ'S is where everyone sits down at a table order some raw meat, they also get some side dishes like to go with it. Once they get the raw meat they cook it have ever they want, in the small grill in the mibble of the table. Kimchi is another type of food that I like beacuse it's spicy and I love spicy foods. But the best part adout the food in Korea is the street food beacuse it's so cheap but yet so tasty that I could die for it.

Another reason, is the beautiful places in Korea. Visiting the Han River a great first place to go when you get to Korea. Han River has lots of beautiful pink bloosom tree's which are great for taking photograghs. Generic_City is a city that is very populated with people. Generic_City is just like California here in the United State beacuse it's where all the famous people live at. The best part of Generic_City is the performances beacuse you get to see so many talented people show off there skills with rapping, dancing, and singing. The beaches in Korea are a great place for families to have bonding time together, especially in Busan.

Finally, the best part is ""me time"" which means I can get time for myself. Decent hotels are really hard to find but every single hotel in Korea looks amazing from the inside and from the outside. Every single thing in the hotel in is clean beacuse korean people don't like to be messy they love to be organized. The relaxition spa's are great, to have some ""me time"" they do foot massages, faciaul treatment and more. Yoga is even more relaxing then anything else beacuse it helps your mind conitrait and balance its self in order to distress. These are the main things I suggest you to do if you want to realease the stress and have some ""me time"".

In conlusion, I suggest you to take a trip to korea. One, is beacuse the food is great, especially the street food. Second, it have the most amazing places to visit like Han River. Last but not least, is the relaxation time i can get for myself. Well its time for me to catch a flight to korea. I hope i see you there too.

Self-esteem comes from achieving, it will make you feel good about yourself. For example, if Generic_Name achieves shooting five times at the three point line and makes all of them; he will feel good about himself. His self-esteem is feeling good so he may try to do more next time at the three point line. But feeling good about yourself is not the only thing that will help with your self-esteem.

Another is it will make you feel that you could do anything. For example, if Generic_Name wins the art fair only in her class, but the school is having an art fair for the whole sophomore class. Her self-esteem will kick in and she may sign up

Also you can learn how to not give up for example if Generic_Name lose the class discussion but the class is going to have another one the next day she is going to try her hardest to win the next class discussion.

I think that achievement will help kids with their learning because nowadays kids like winning and winning things at the end it makes their self-esteem built up.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.6,2

My name is Generic_Name. I attend Generic_School and i am a student athlete,i play soccer and football and based on my experience in these sports i agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson.

I have three main reasons why i agree Author Emerson,and the first reason is to get better at what you are doing you have to take bigger steps. In order for me to get better at football and soccer, i have to try to do something beyond what i used to do. I take personal Fitness in school and my goal is to get stronger, but i cannot get stronger if i keep on lifting the same weights i can not i get stronger if am always benching the same weight.

My second reason is that, it helps you win a race or in other words it can help you win a compettion. It is just like Uber competing with lyft, they both good at what they do but in order for uber to gain more customers they have to try to do something that is beyond what they have mastered. I play as a striker in soccer and i play as conerback in football but am not the only striker on the socccer team and am not the only cornerback on the football team so in order for me to start on the team i have to work harder than i used to.

My third reason is it will help you be successful in life. I just found out that the owner of Amazon started in a garage,when i first heard i told myself that he wouldn't be successful if did not take bigger steps in life and even though he is successful he is still taking bigger steps. Also, Trump had everything he wanted cars,money, houses but still wanted to compete with Clinton for the presidency. Let's use an iphone for instance,the more they keep on upgrading it the more they gain more customers. A lot of successful entrepreneurs took bigger steps by getting a loan to start their business.

Some people will say you don't have to try to do something beyond what you have mastered,you just have to try to do new things but trying new things does not help you grow because how is adding another workout to my old workout making me stronger?,I have to increase the weight to make me stronger or how am i gaining more customers or how am i growing or how is my business growing if am still working from a garage?, in order for my business to grow or for me to gain more customers i have to take some bigger steps like getting loan to find a new place.

I agree with Author Emerson because you can be perfect in what you do,you can be perfect in life but you have to try to do something beyond what you have already mastered to keep you growing.",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.7,2
3507,EF45D0314A20,"Almost 95% of people goes to the beach or swimming pools, and I imagined what enjoyable activity to do. I think swimming club is the most enjoyable activity. Swimming is an enjoyable activity because it helps me calm whenever i'm mad, I can also swim with my friends and play together, and it is also more easier and exciting to exercise whenever i'm swimming.

First of all, swimming is an enjoyable activity because it helps me calm whenever i'm mad or feeling down. Last year, when the school just finished, and all of the people left, I jumped into the pool and just swam. It made me happy because as I swam into the surface of the water, I heard the water droplets drop as I moved my feet up and down, the sound of the wave made me sleepy as they touched the wall, and the sound of the gushing water that made me feel alive as I went out of the pool. Another example would be, when I was on a field trip, we all went to the beach and stayed there for two days. As the day goes by, I was sad and upset because I didn't want to leave. What I did was I changed my clothes, took my camera, and went outside. As I walk on the sandy beach, I heard the waves as if they were ready to eat me, I heard the birds chirping as I take a picture of them. It was a very fun and calm day. That is why swimming is an enjoyable activity because it helps me calm.

Second of all, swimming is an enjoyable activity because you get to swim with your friends, even make new friends! An example would be when I was swimming alone, I was okay because I don't really mind being alone, but when my friends came, they instantly made me laugh. All of us were doing tricks and racing with each other, which is very fun. One time, when my friends was swiming underwater, they bumped each other's head and as they reach to the surface, three of us laughed. Also, learning how to swim is easier because swimming is fun, and it's more fun with your friends. An example would be your friend can help you out when you're struggling how to float. Even doing dog swim is hard for some people, which is easy for me. Also, learning by yourself isn't fun, learning with your friends is more fun. That is why swimming is an enjoyable activity because you get to swim with your friends.

Lastly, swimming is an enjoyable activity because it's mpre exciting to exercise when you're swimming. I once took a swimming lesson every friday after school. I didn't like it at first, but as soon as my third day came, I liked it so much. I gained 145 pounds for a ten year old, but when I took my swimming lesson, my weight decreased to 111 pounds. You don't really see the result, until you started having fun on what you're doing. An example would be I was really not into swimming and all I wanted to do there is to lose weight. I didn't see any improvement onj my swimming skills, and I didn't lose weight at all. Weeks passed and I started losing weight, and im becoming more better at swimming. I thought is because I got more passionate and determined when swimming that I didn't see those changes. After all what i've been through, swimming made me happy at all times. That is how swimming impacted my life.

It's more exciting and easier to exercise when swimming, you can swim with your friends and play together, and it helps me calm whenever i'm mad, and that is why swimming is an enjoyable activity. It is important for people to know this is because this is a real life story. It already helped three people when they read this.

2331,AD53B357BD0D,"Have you ever had a really important decision you had to make? Did you feel overwhelmed because you didn't know what you should do? Asking for help or advise from people such as friends and family around you can really help alleviate all that stress. Most people encounter big decisions often throughout their lives, so getting advise from numerous people can help you get more input on something, and may end up helping you make a final decision. Seeking multiple opinions can really help someone make a better choice when dealing with decision making.

One way seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is that by asking more than one person, they can get more input. Asking numerous people can be a huge help when making an important decision. Not only are people getting different ideas of what they may want to do, they can also get advise from people who may be more experienced than themselves. For example, if someone was debating on which college they should apply to, they may end up asking people such as older siblings or parents for advise because they may have more experience with that matter. By asking multiple people, you can get multiple ideas, each of them being different in their own way. By getting more people's input, you may be able to start to make your own choice about the matter because of the advise you've gotten.

Another way seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is by not getting any biased opinions. By asking more than one person for advise on a subject, they can get more than one new idea that isn't one of their own. This way, they can get more than one person's thoughts on the decision, and have different ideas on it. For example, if someone were trying to make a decision on what sport they may want to tryout for at school, they could possibly ask their friends and family about which they should choose. However, they should also ask people like classmates and teachers, as they may have their own ideas, and won't give the person any biased ideas or information. Friends and family can have a great deal of influence on people, so it's important to always get people's thoughts that are on the outside. This will make it to where there's a greater chance of the decision maker not being biased, as they've heard numerous people's thoughts, and can make their own decision off of that.

A final way seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is by being more prepared about the choice they're going to make. The decision maker can use all the advise they've gotten from different people to make their own choice, and feel better prepared. They will be more focused as they know what they want to do, and will feel more confident and less overwhelmed. Feeling less overwhelmed can be a big help as the person doesn't have to be so worried, so they won't have any distractions from making the best possible decision. For example, if someone is trying to decide what kind of car they want to get, and they've gotten advise from numerous people, they can make a better choice when picking. They'll know exactly what they want, as they've heard many thoughts from the people around them, and so they can make their final decision.

After getting advise from multiple people around them, the decision maker may be able to make the best choice possible, as they've gotten new thoughts and ideas. Asking for help or for some advise from those around you can help you make the best possible choice because you've gotten a lot of new information and opinions that you wouldn't have gotten if you had only asked one or no one at all for advise. Making an important choice can seem a little bit easier and less stressful after seeking advise from multiple people. Getting help from others around you can help you make the best choice you can.

3238,E21BAA47A9F4,"People almost always credit their success by having a good attitude because they treat people the way they want to get treated, it makes other people happy and it makes the them happier. Having a good attitude to another person makes that same person give you that same attitude back, and to other people. They spread good vibes, and it makes them feel happier. Giving a complement to someone every day can lead them to doing the same thing. Having a good attitude can lead to having good karma so next someone says ""nice shoes"" to a random person. That someone will get treated with good karma like passing their test the next day.

Having a good attitude to people at school can lead to having more friends, and getting treated better. By treating the teacher with respect, and kindness. It can make the teacher do you same thing back. Good attitude is the key to success, and every famous person you see on TV always has a good attitude. Maybe thats why there successesful and famous all that hard work they put into their job. When someone has a good attitude it's most likely thier happy, or everyone they talked with was happy.

But sometimes there's a sad person and to make thier day or cheer them up a complemant can help. By saying their outfit looks good, or their hair cut looks better than last time. It can cause them to feel better and do the same thing back to someone else that's having a bad day. There's also people that have good attitudes to make them selfs feel better It's like leaving chruch you fell happier. But coming to church it's just feels good.

Having a bad attitude can effect other peoples mood it can make them happy or sad. Having a good attitude makes more people happier and feel calm. Attitude effects almost all of the day and other peoples day including your family and pets. If your mad all day it's because someone was mad to you or just got effected by it from someone eles.

It's just better to have a good attitude all day than being mad all day and causing other people to be mad insted of being happy. Being happy in the worst times in your life is a good thing and can change your fellings somehow. I would rather have a good day in a bad day than have a bad day. If half of the world had a good attitude next thing you now the whole world has a good attitude. But people don't like doing that they rather be mean to other people and that's why the whole world is violent and wars start and people die Because people don't have good attitudes.

Good attitude effects a lot of people like in music and in movies sometimes it's good and sometimes it's bad. People that are famous and have bad attitudes are really common they get mad at their fans but the fans is the only reason why their famous and rich. Rich people are usually the sad ones and the poor are usually the happier ones because they have better attitudes.

Good attitudes effect a lot and so do bad ones that's why thiers all types of people in the world. Good ones and bad ones the ones with good attitude and the ones with bad attitude. Good attitudes effect friends and family and that's why people should always have good attitudes. One time I was testing and I had a good attitude but when I saw my score I had a bad attitude for the rest of the day. And the same things happens when my parents are mad at each other it gives me a bad attitude for the rest of the day in school and in soccer. But when someone is nice to me or gives me a complement I feel better about myself and it chages my attitude.

Sometimes having a good attitude in the worst times is bad like having a good attitude in a funaral or at a sad movie. But sometimes it's best to be happy and have a good attitude to spread good energy to other people and family. It's sometimes good to have a bad attitude so people can know your sad and be happier near you to cheer you up. Being nice and having a good attitudes can really change someones day so try it and complement people so they will do the same thing back.

I usually have a good attitude even when I have a really bad headache or am sick because having a bad attitude is not fun. and it makes other people have bad days or feel bad so that's why I always have a Good attitude. To other people and my family so they will all have a good attitude and that's why having a bad attitude is bad because it causes bad thing and we don't need that we need to be nice and help other people. Thats why people are so mean and don't care.

And that's why problems start and people get mad and that's why you should have a good attitude everyday to make other people happier.        ",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.9,2

Mistakes help you learn and get better and better until you understand the concept about what you are doing. Some people think that by making mistakes you will fail something, but notes that at the end you will get results from it. A lot of people fail everyday and that doesn't mean that you're not perfect because no one is perfect in these world, but the main idea is to look for the best way to manage or do something and also to keep forward.

Failure is just the key to keep looking forward in these world. We have the opportunity to make mistakes and learn from it, that is how people progress to became someone in the future. failure is a lesson that these world give us to keep learning and at the end to find a solution and continue our lives. however, there are a lot of people that think that failure is like an stop sign that don't let us keep looking forward, but failure is just a process in which people advance to find results that will help them to survive in these life.

Some people stop where they are just because they fail on something, they think that they can not keep going forward just for a little mistake they have committed and they also give up.

2235,A72FE8731B45,"Ever since i started school i never liked the school lunch, i would always go the whole day without eating and I would'nt take a snack or anything so it could sustain in my stomach. Most kids at my school dont like the school lunch either, because they either think it tast wierd or just they are just picky about what they eat. Normally, when I would go almost a whole day with out eating my head would hurt or stomach and i know most teenagers in my school can relate also because they prefer to starve and not eat the food that the school serves. In my opinion. I believe that changing the schools lunch menu and making it healthier is a good idea because kids would enjoy the food, parents would not conplain about their kids not eating in schhol, and it would be a great advantage to improve the school lunch.

Most kids think that the school lunch is not very appetizing, but if the school cafeteria decides to change the school menu it would make a huge difference beacuse I know that most kids especially teenagers are very picky about their food or that it's disgusting. When I was younger I would'nt eat at school and until this day I don't because i didnt like and i would always have somach aches, and my head would hurt a lot, and i wasent able to concentrate in class. Most kids think that its not neccesary for the school cafeteria to change the menu but in reality most kids don't eat at school due the type of food they serve. Sometimes even the parents say something to their kids because they dont eat in school.

When i would go to middle school and the beginning of high school my parents would always wonder why I woud'nt eat at school, they got to a point where they thought i was depressed and i would always get yelled at because they thought something was wrong with me when in reality i just didnt like the school lunch. I understand why most kids dont like the school food because either it doesnt have flavor or it just doesnt taste the same as before, and also sometimes the food would make me feel sick from the stomach afterwards. Parents main concern is if their kids eat or not. I believe that by changing the menu it would would much better for parents to stop worrying about why their kids about why they dont like to eat at school. My parents especially my mom would barely have time to make me something, for example, she didnt have time to make me a snack or something real quick so I could have taken it to school when I was in elementary school, she would always tell me that she did'nt have time that she was always in a rush and thats why sometimes I would'nt eat. My mom almost went to put complain about the school food and that she wondered if I was the only one that would'nt eat in school.

I believe that if the school cafeteria has a advantage to change the school cafeteria food because they should think about why parents worry about their kids not eating and also parents putting complaint of why their chidfren don't eat at school. In my honest opinion i think that they should shange the menu because when I dont well or i dont eat at all it is hard for me to concentrate in class and that is a huge priority to pay attention in class and try to get good grades. If the school cafeteria plans to change the cafeteria food it would be really great because more kids will be able to concentrate. When i was in freshman an sophmore year I would always skip to go eat because I coud'nt eat the school food, i think that kids nowadays do the same thing just so they wont starve.

In my honest opinion i belive that changing the school food would be a great idea because most kids dont concentrate in class, parents worry about their kids, and also they it would make a great impact on the schhol.           ",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.7,2
3194,E069D2A8AE1E,"Have you had a friend sharing wisdom and experiences with you? You probably had that a million times. Here is the thing though. People just want to learn the experience of you and the others, which isn't a bad thing. It's also important to learn each other's experiences. I think it is important to learn from other people's experiences because you get to understand who they are, you can help the person if they're in a situation, and you can communicate each other. To clarify this, let's dig in deeper.

First, I think it's important that you understand who they are because you get to know about their favorite hobbies, the places they like to visit, the pets they have and their dream vacation. Getting to know on who the person is can give you a good start off to make a bond, or form friendship between you and that person. If you shared your experiences with a person, they might feel interested on what you're talking about. Telling a person on what you like can bring that person's attention deeper.

Second, it's important that you help the person if they're in a situation because you can cheer them up if they lost a family member. Helping someone out can make that person feel better and most of all, feel comfortable, and they will think that you're a good person. If you didn't reach out and help somebody, they could start getting into a tougher situation where they might not be able to handle by themselves. They could also feel very lonely or left out, and that is not okay.

Third, communicating with others is important because you can text them in Social Media, such as Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook. You can also go shopping with them. Communicating others bring closer friendship, and keep the bond strong between you and you're friend. Watching movies and hanging out at each others house are another examples of communication. They're lots of ways to communicate with your friends and other people, and that is a good thing for friends. Activities is another thing for communicating with other people because sometimes, when people do activities, it provides teamwork.

In Conclusion,

I think it is important to learn from other people's experiences because you get to understand who they are, you can help the person if they're in a situation, and you can communicate each other. So now that you understand, think about these as you make new friends. Question yourself on how to get a good start to form a bond between you and that person. Try to reach out and help him/her if they need help with something. Make that person feel comfortable by hanging out with them at lunch or at home. They might need good company from you!

Employers need to know that they can rely on this person in rough time. A trustworthy person who can help the team be better and cooperate positively.

No employer would hire someone who can't be at work in time, someone who always finds excuses to stay at home, someone who can't accept to be wrong.

I remember the way I was raised. My mother do not know how to read just because her parents were poor. In my country, Haiti, school is very expensive and not accessible for everyone. But, I had this opportunity because my mother made the impossible become possible. As she always said, '' Je me leve a l'aube du jour et m'endorme apres le couche du soleil pour que tu sois fiere de toi meme, et sois capable d'aider les gens comme moi. "" I graduated high school with advanced diploma. My mother died. She did not have the chance to see the fruit of her hard-work.

I want to make her pride from where she is. Because she was a hard-worker. She is my model. I have known how it felt to be miserable, dependent, be rejected, to count on someone, to fail again and again.

Even though I did not go to college, I am proud of myself. I can read, write, and speak not only one language but, 3 different ones.

I have learned to offer the better side of me in anything I am doing. I will not say I am the ""Albert Einstein'' of this generation but, I am intelligent , fast learner, humble and cooperative.

2740,C97C2190DB65,"Imagine someone asking another person wheither they should go to a friend's party or to the movies, but he or she told them something like, ""It's up to you to decide, not me"". That person eventually agrees; but when they finally decide on wheither to go to the party or to the movies at the last minuate, they end up missing out on both. Sometimes, making decisions on your own can be pretty tough and frustrating, but it helps you become more independent and you do not have to relay on other people's decisions.

People can not depend on other people for what they think all the time. It shows that instead of being progressive with their work or anything else they're doing, that person can not make up their minds or is just being lazy and is always looking for someone else's opinions instead of their own. This also shows that they are not self-reliant or progressive like how most people usually are.

Making our own decisions also means following our own intincts. For example, a group of teenagers are planning to skip school to got the beach for the entire day. They try to convince two other of their classmates to join them, but they told them no and that they are going to get in trouble for missing out on their classes. Trusting our intincts can be very helpful when it comes to things like skipping school, alcohol, or even having sex with someone. It can maybe even save your life or someone else's in the future.

It also helps people become more independent on their own. People can not always depend on their parents for the rest of their lives, they will have to move out of the home they grow up in to start looking for jobs and earning to support themselves. Another example is when a teenager starts appling for colleges that they want to go once they graduate from high school. They probably have been told that college will help them get ready for when they are ready to get a full-time job (which also has to be something they want to do for a long period of time), pay taxes and bills for when they have a house or apartment to live in, and maybe even take care of their familes.

People should make their own decisions because they can not always depend on other people's opinions, they should follow their own intincts that can probably save their lives one day, and it helps them become more independent to get ready for the future.   ",4.0,4.5,4.0,4.5,3.5,4.0,4.2,2
2733,C928D32FE5C5,"Are vacations a necessity to us and to our success? Why do we need them? While some say that inactivity gives us time to reinvent ourselves. Others believe that it instigates procrastination. Inactivity serves a purpose because it keeps us from giving up and it allows us time for new ideas.

Inactivity serves a purpose because it keeps us from giving up. For example, I was once taking a very long test that lasted around 4 to 5 hours. At first, I was just guessing my way through it because I was very tired and ready to give up. Then, we were given a five minute break so I got up and walked around a bit. After walking for a few minutes, I was energized and ready to finish the test. With my new found energy, I was very content with the test and my score. In fact, students who take mental breaks during long testing periods score 31% higher than the ones who did not take any breaks. In conclusion, inactivity keeps us enthusiastic about our work.

Inactivity serves a purpose because it allows us time for new ideas. For example, one of my friends named Generic_Name once did not go to school for three days. During these three days, she organized her school essentials and cleaned up her room. Since she was working on a project before the break, she had time to finish it and she even had another project idea for her science class. She obtained a good grade on both projects. In fact, students who have taken breaks during long tests, like the SOL, say that after their break they had a better understanding of the test. Even the workforce workers are encouraged to take a few days off. It helps the worker get more creative. Even the owner of a business need a vacation. In fact, around 56% of entrepreneurs say that they came up with at least one new idea after a vacation. Inactivity helps prepare our minds for when we are active.

Inactivity serves a purpose. Inactivity keeps us from throwing in the towel. it gives us a mental break; which, creates time for new ideas. Some believe that inactivity encourages laziness. However, it gives us time to rejuvenate our attitude and our mindset. If we take more breaks, to let our mind wonder, we would be more effective in anything it is we are doing.

936,475AAF4D130E,"Most successful people keep study new carrers or leanirng new tasks to do in order to became even wealthier and to not get bored of doing the same job daily. Ralph Emerson states that, you will never grow if you do not try something new that you already know. Meaning that if people do not expand their knowledge after of what they already know they will never accomplish more to became more successful in life. However, if you are willing to expand you horizons and break out the comfort zone, you will grow and achieve higher goals. Trying something new of what you already mastered help people to grow because it lead people will live real experiences and it provide more opportunities. and it break the comfort zone.

To star with, the more people learn, the more opportunities they have. Opportunities are provide for people that are open to learn new things and grow in what they do. For instance, I have been working in a part-time in a salad place for two years. The first year I learned all the work stations which I was really good at it. After a year, I realized that it was the time to expand my knowledge and also to ask for a raise. I became a valid trainer in all the store's stations. Now I teach new workers and assist them how to do their task in the correct way and they are paying me better. This shows that if I would not be open to learn how to be a trainer at the store, I would not be paying as well as today. Being capable to try something new offer better opportunities in order to grow rather than getting stuck in the same place without trying to achieve higher goals.

Moreover, the desire to try different things make people to live many wonderful experiences. If people never expand their horizons , they will never experiences the adventures life has to offer. For instance, Last summer I went to a campus in a university to get more information about careers that I was interested in. I meet wonderful students from other schools and learned computer science. The teachers provided me the information and requirements to get into the University and the different classes that I have to take in order to get a degree in computer sciences. Also, we practiced several methods to create graphs and draw in the computers. Since, I visited that place I got more convince to study computer science in the future and it is a experience that I will never forget because I realized that I have the skills to study that career as my major. If I would not go , I will never notice that I could study computer science in the out coming. Learning new things lead to live and learn experiences that help people to grow in their future.

As can be seen,

it is better to try something new because people can explore experiences that will never forget and and they will learn new things to became even more successful in their lives. People have the right to never stop learning and get new skills that will prepared them for whatever they want to accomplish and change about their routine.

1351,6805FE96E548,"Students having the option to have distance learning would only be great for students who are responsible and cable of keeping up with their assignments. Distance learning is beneficial to students because they won't have to worry about getting up early to go to school and also, don't have to worry about that amount of time they have in class to finish an assignment. Taking online classes gives the student more freedom to expand their thinking while having their own space at home.

A way that distance learning benefits students is not having to wake up at 6 or 7 am in the morning to go to school. Some kids don't show their full attention in school because they're not a morning person. Having to wake up in the morning and sit in a classroom for 2 hours is uncomfortable. For example, I'm not the type of student that can sit in a classroom for 2 hours or more and listen to a teacher talk. I would, prefer to move around and also eat while i'm doing my work that makes me feel more focus. But, in high school your not allowed to randomly get up and walk around it would make the teacher feel unsafe or the students. Waking up at 9 to 10 is a good time to start your online classes because you had enough time to wake up shower , eat and that most important part is that you dont have worry about what clothes your going to wear to school.

Another reason that distance learning is beneficial to students is because as high school students is not really easy to keep up with a teacher. when they're teaching a lesson with 28 more students in the classroom that probably already understood the assignments. There are some teachers are just not the type to go back and repeat their self. For example, When a student miss class it feels like you missed a whole quarter. The teacher is not going to explain the whole lesson to 1 student she would simply say check online for the assignment. This is an example of why students would prefer to take online classes because theres no way a student can be absent. Student can walk around anywhere with their computer or phone and simply pull up the school work and start doing it on their free time.

Some students would say its better to come to school, meet people and have the high school experiences. Although it sounds fun. Theres still students that would prefer being home and getting their work down at home then being in school dealing with drama or extra assignments. Theres students who would rather focus on online classes and finish them and also have a part time job on the side to help them pay for their colleges.

In conclusion, distance learning is an advantage to students who are proactive and for students who learn better on their own. Having to do your school work online and especially at home makes it feel more comfortable. Its also helping students get ready for the real world when they have to take home assignments from work and make sure to stay focus.     ",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.9,2

However, when people fail, they think they should give up and stop trying. It's important to discuss about these different sides. Churchill's statement is important for not giving up or quitting.

The first reason why we should never give up is that we learn from our mistakes. when you fail at something you have to understand that it's not the end of the world. If you don't get something right or you mess up on it, you'll know to get it right next time. It's always important to recognize that you can reach for you're goals to be successful. when you fight for what you believe in, you'll never go wrong.

The second reason why you should never give up is because you want to reach you're top goals. When you want something, you have to fight for it. People who fail or didn't do something right, they give up and say that they have wasted their time, But in life, we can't always win or do something right. we are bound to fail at some point in our lives and it doesn't feel good. However, we keep on pushing for it because we want to be successful and feel great about ourselves to know that we didn't give up.

On the other side, when people give up, they have fail. People who think they have what it takes to be able to get a job, being able to go to a good school, or pursuit their dreams without mistakes, is someone who's going to give up the moment they've fail. The people who got great jobs or got into a good school, worked hard for it. Even when things went bad, they didn't give up because they work hard for that purpose. Some people who fail, often say that they're not smart or not that good. If your not that smart, how are you here today? When you struggle on something, you have to understand that the people around you are the people that can help you with deal with you're problems. Friends and families are the people who can help you in your time of need.

Finally, whenever you have a goal or something you want to have, it's important to never give up or quit halfway through. A goal is something you want to have and by working hard, you know you'll able to reach it in no time. Whenever you get stuck or something goes wrong, you always have support from the people you know very well to help you.

784,3CDD56FF3477,"Today, at school, most people are required by teachers to work with a group in order to prepare them to work in society and be able to communicate with their future colleague. I believe that there is more benefits for students to work with others rather than working by their own because they can share their ideas together and don't work alone allow them to be faster.

First, by working with a group students can share their ideas and discuss on the work they have to do. By sharing their ideas, their work will be stronger and longer because every person of the group bring his own point of view, his own examples or experiences and their own way to work, to proceed. While working alone can be difficult when the student have no ideas or is lost and don't know how to do his work, so in a group they can help each others to understand and push them to work For example, if in a group a person have more facilities on the topic than others, she can help others who have more difficulties to work. Working by groups allow students to grow and enrich their skills to be better because they learn from each others. Working with a group help them to be prepared for working by their own.

Secondly, working with other students can be more efficient. Students, by sharing ideas, are working faster because they don't have to find all by them self and do all the work. They can share tasks so one person have one job rather than do everything alone so it's more efficient and beneficent for all the group but also for the teacher because the work will be done faster, so the class can move on and do more things during the year and if they help each other they probably don't need help from teachers, so teachers can be focus on students with real difficulties. Working with a group can prepare them for their future jobs so they can be able to communicate to other people and learn how to work not only for them self but also for everyone and they learn to help each other so they will be more productive in the future. For example, if in the future, they will work in a society where they need to work together on a project with many people and their boss don't want them to work by their own, they already learn how to be efficient in a community so it won't be a problem for them. They will be already used to work with a group and they will know how to proceed.

Some people can think that working by groups can do the opposite and prevent students to work by talking, laughing, having fun with their friends, which can be distracting them or if a person in the group don't want to work it can impact other's work so it's unfair for people who really want to work and are motivated to have a good grades. However, students can keep working at home if they are late on their work, they can communicate by phone or they can meet during the weekend or after school so the work can be done in time or teachers can make the groups in order to prevent distractions. Also, if a person don't want to work and impact other's work, the person will be graded lower which can motive her to work or if it's not the case, students from the group can help her and to be motivated and push her to work by giving her little tasks to do or easy tasks.

In conclusion, I think that working with a group bring more benefits for students rather than working alone because they can share their ideas, their way to proceed and work faster by helping each others. If teachers want their students to be more efficient and enrich them self for their future, it's important that they do more activities and work in groups. ",5.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,4.0,4.0,2

Everyday after school my brother and I go to the library to do our homework, when we get there I don't have any contact with him nor him with me. Nowadays, when I go to the library I can see many people sitting there, staring at the screen of a computer without having contact with the other person that it is near them. Having access to technology has positive effects but it also have negative effects. The limitation use of technology has negative effects on people's lives because it keeps us away from the ones that are near us, it can damage our way of living, and also it can make us to become addicted to it.

While we are in touch with technology, we are keeping away our self from the ones that are near us. For example, I have this friend we have always eat lunch together none of us have a cellphone, but one day my friend came to school with a cellphone that her mom bought for her. We were eating lunch, I was talking to her, but she was not listening to me because she was more into her cellphone than me. Technology can allow us to have contact with the ones that are far away from us, but we need to manage our time we can talk to them when we are alone and not when we are near a person that we can talk to. Having any type of technology near us while we are with somebody else it is not a good idea. Therefore, one day I decided to let my friend being herself with her cellphone, and I stop eating lunch with her. Technology send me away from her even though maybe she did not want that to happened. From that day I learned that if I want to keep the person that it is always near me, I just need to give them more attention instead of giving all my attention to a cellphone.

To continue, technology can damage our way of living, it can effect us in a way that we have not even think about it. For instance, when I turned seventeen years old my parents bought me a cellphone, from then I was too lazy to do my homework and refuse to talk to them because I have a cellphone and I can be in contact with the ones that are not near me. Access to technology made me lazy and careless about school. One day my parents decided to took my cellphone for a week I was really mad at them that I stop eating and then I got sick. Meanwhile, technology can help people with their tasks, but it can also make people careless about important things that can be useful for their future.

Some say that the use of technology have a great positive effect in our life, but I disagree with it because the use of technology it just stop us from being active with others and become careless about things that we were interesting in. For example, I was really interested on taking dancing lessons, so I decided that I can just watch dancing videos in my computer and it will be the same, but actually I did not watch the dancing lesson videos, I ended up watching something else that it does not have anything to do with dancing lessons. While some people think that technology have positive effects, I don't think the same. With the use of technology everyday we become addicted to it. Therefore I think technology does not have positive effect on people's life it might have some positives effects but there are more negative effects than positives.

In conclusion, Technology allows people to complete many tasks and can help us to connect with others around the world but are we really giving some time to the ones that are near us? I don't think so. Let's be positive don't let technology take away the people near us. Let's think smart we can do better in our life without being sitting there for an hour or more staring to a computer, cellphone or another electronic device when we can be enjoying the people that it is always there for us, near to us, and giving their time to us.

Working with someone else can bring many benefits and opportunities to everyone, but there is many people who prefer to work by their self . working in a group can help to have done everything on time, and we can establish a good environment in the classroom. Each person have different opinions, and we have to respect it.

Working in groups help to have everything done on time, since we are gathering many types of ideas and information from everyone. For example, in USA there are a diversity of people from different parts around the world, and each person have a different opinions and ideas in how they see everything. However, some people think that they have better opinions about what they are doing than others, but an opinion or idea is just a help that can guide to the best option. Having groups in classes is a help that can benefit. Because, they are helping each other. When someone is working alone can be struggling and do not ask for any type of help to keep going and make things nicely.

When we are working in groups, we can establish a good environment with our classmates, since there is a lot of communication between classmates. For example, if we work alone, we would not be able to communicate each other, because, everyone is concentrate in what are they doing. Otherwise, people from different parts of the country would not have the opportunities to meet each other and learn different cultures from their classmates. Knowing each other can create a calm and gradable place to stay and share with every student in the classroom. Even other students would prefer to be there.

They were not able to finish their homework because, they did not know how to do it. Teachers do not usually have the time to go through each student, and help them in class, but some teachers volunteer to meet with students who have difficulty in certain subjects in an after school homework club. Joining an after school homework club is a great way to finish your homework in time. Sometimes teacher might even give students some tips and tricks on how to solve a question, that they would not give out in class. My friend Generic_Name used to have a lot of difficulties with his math homework until he joined the after school homework club in our school. He learned many tricks on how to solve a math equation and even taught a trick to solve an ""Integer Slope Inequality"" equation.

Moving on, an after school homework club can help students become more socially interactive. While in an after school homework club, you can find students with the same difficulties as you. This will give students something to relate to and not feel out of place. Having group discussions on how to solve a problem and having group projects in your club will also help you be more socially interactive. My friend Generic_Name made many friends by joining the after school homework club in our school, and grew a lot of confidence. He is now much less nervous when talking to people than before.

Lastly, homework clubs can give students teaching experience for if they want to be a teacher when they grow up. Students can volunteer to help other students finish their homework in an after school homework club. This will give the student a lot of experience on how to teach, and deal with other students. There is a team of students is our school called the "" Junior Honor Society"", which helps students with academic difficulties every day after school. As a member, I have learned about a lot of ways to teach someone else, and because of my desire to be a teacher one day, this helps me a lot.

Schools should establish homework clubs because it can help students finish their homework, become more socially interactive , and can give students teaching experience. Ten out ten students have said that, joining an after school homework club has been the best decision they made in their life.",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5.0,4.6,2
3853,FDE0B653AD74,"When you play activities or an instrument, don't you get a relief when you play them?

I like to play volleyball, because I can make new friends, it gives me an opportunity in life to have a good life, and it is really fun to hit the ball when it flies really close to you.

My first reason is that I can make new friends. Having friends is an amazing thing, because you can always rely on your friend and have some kind of connection to them. Friends will help you at any time, whether it is hard times, bad grades, fight with someone, arguments and others. Friends are always there for you and it does not need to be a daily conversation with them to be friends. If you have friends, you will have more success in your life and it will give you new opportunities in life, such as, jobs and etc. When you become friends with someone, you become a different person and everyone around you are happy and you also can make a difference in the world if you have more opportunities to have a great life.

My second reason is that the games give me more opportunities to participate in any activities that I am interested in. Doing activities is good, because it keeps you healthy and a more enjoyable person. When you play sports it teaches you math, because the ball is circular and it has a circumference, radius, and a diameter. People don't just play sports, they play sports, because they enjoy them and when you play it, it feels like that you are free and able to do anything in the world. When you believe you can do it, you will be able to do it, you just don't need to give up if something goes wrong.

My third reason is that it is fun to hit the ball when it flies towards you. It is fun, because it give you new experiences and different feelings that you have never had felt before. But to play a sport you have to have good grades and a good spirit of wanting to play the game. Sports are like your new life, because when you start playing, you cannot stop. It feels like you are addicted to the game and that it is so fun that you cannot stop playing it. When you are in a team, it gives a different feeling, because you have to work hard to get into the team. You don't just go and play a sport, it has to include how hard enough you have worked to play in that sport.

My fourth reason is that you should never give up on any sport, if you already started it. Sports also give a different point of view of people. Having feelings is a really good experience, because it shows a whole different part of our personality. Sports give you a life experience that you will never forget, even if you are old. And, whenever you feel along you can go talk to your teammates about it and they will help you out with it. Teammates are the best part of the game, because they open so many new doors to you and you just have to work hard enough that you can go through the doors that you chose to live with.

My final reason is that even perfect people make mistakes in games. If you want to be perfect in a game, you just have to practice a lot to become better and better at it. Practicing show your teammates that you care about them and the game. New friends always pop out from different angles in your life. Life without friends would be miserable, because you have nobody to help you in anything.

Playing volleyball is really important to me , because I can make new friends it is really fun to hit the ball when it comes towards you, and give opportunities for a new and better life.

In conclusion, sports are really fun, because you can always gain courage in the game. You can experience things you never experienced before. It can make you want to become a coach, because if you are a coach it will be fun to give kids what they want to play and get new ideas of new kinds of games that they can play. Your life doesn't always depend on the game, because we always have something else to do even if we have a game and it is always hard to find what time you are going to play the game. It is how the life will be when you are a grown up. Our lives always give us surprises that we don't expect. Sports are the most important thing in our lives, because they helps us overcome our fears of communicating with people.",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.7,2
2893,D16B3304A010,"A positive attitude is the key to success in life.

Can you imagine the world without positivity? Some people are doing successful achievements through the positive attitude, but others have a discrepancy to that. I believe that positivite attitude is important because positivity points to the healthy mental health, genial and successful accomplishments.

To begin with first reason, there are successful and unsuccessful people in the world. We are all humans, and we all have feelings, strenghts, weakneasses. Usually, those weaknesses make me stronger and give me lessons, and good lessons bring the keys to the successful doors. Life is like a school, teaches, tests, grades. However, my attitude decides who I want to be, but the importance is in being positive.

Another reason, ""being positive"" for me means being patient. For example, the person who is admiring me everytime. He is my father. I know all of his experiences connected with his job. There were a diffucult times too but because of his positive attitude, he is at proffessional level of his military career. I remember, when he had strict bosses, not very loyal friends, when we had the money shortgage. My parents teach me everytime: ""It doesn't matter where are you, be mature show them respect, take your community to the positive sides, be kind. Therefore, it will help you to be successful"".

On the other hand, some people say that the world is diffucult and success is not in the positivity because there are other things like money, good community, good education. Yes, that is true, but thinking positive and having efforts to accomlish something, that is already success. Success doesn't mean being rich and eminent. For me success is when I follow my dreams, help people, motivate them to be positive. However, there is the times when there is no place positivity, like loosing someone, or being unresponsible for something, hurting someone's feelings.

Eventually, to be successful in life, I have to stay positive in difficult situations. I like to be humor ,when I want to cry. I am responsible for my life and I choose positivity to achieve accomlpishments to be better and helpful to the community because that would help me to be successful and success makes the bliss!",4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.6,2
1862,8C3557D720F5,"Do you want to know some enjoyable ways to do at the park? Well, at the park you can walk your dog, you can have a picnic with family or friends, some parks have animals you can look at, and you can ride your bike, skate board, and scooter.

One enjoyable thing to do at the park is, you can walk our dog. While you are walking your do, you are also getting some exercise by walking with them. It's also fun because the dog can explore new places to go to.

Also it's somewhere you can take your dog to go out and enjoy nature with you. Some dogs like walking, so a park is a good place to take them to go walk. Also you and your dog can have some time together.

Another enjoyable way to do at the park is, you can have a picnic with your family of friends. Having a picnic is fun because you get to talk to the person with you and eat with them. Having picnics at the park can be good for example, the weather when it is hot or warm or it is a beautiful day outside. When you are done with your picnic you can go and explore more of the park. If you brought someone with you and they never been there before then they might like it and they would want to come back again.

Third enjoyable way to do at the park is, some parks have animals you can look at. It is enjoyable to look at the animals for example, the bears, fishes, turtles, goats, chickens, and pigs. You can also go look at the pig races. There could be some animals you may have never seen before. Sometimes when you go see the animals at the park some people can tell you some stuff to learn about the animal like where is is from or what it eats and you can feed the animal food that the park provides them to eat.

Last but least, you can ride your bike, stake board, and scooter. At the park you can learn how to ride the the thing you brought and practice. The park is also a safer place because there won't be a lot of cars. While you are riding on what you brought with you, it is fun to ride it while you see the beautiful features of the park. It is a good place to go and play with your friends with bikes, skate boards, and scooters because the park is safer than the street and might be a big park to play at with your friends.",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.8,2
2361,AF8963C142A0,"Benefits on working with a group is a better way to get work done because most students get to use different ideas,Helping each other out with different parts on projects finishing work faster,and communicating with each other is key if working in groups.

However not everyone would agree with this position, because it benefits of working alone is most students don't have to wait on others to do their work. For example The teacher assignes a project and they have to be in groups of five and two of the students do their work and the other three don't do their work. It brings everyone else down.

Working alone makes students not have to worry about others not doing their part of the work.

Most students get to use different ideas when they work on groups. For example students get together to start talking about how they are going work together and start giving differents ideas on how to work better as a group

Working in a group makes students jobs less complicated and stressful by having others helping each other

Working in groups students get to help each other out. For example each student gets to be in charge of one part of the assignment so everyone contributes and work gets done faster. Helping each other out is really important to the group and communication is key when students work in groups.

Communication with each student in the group is really important if students working in groups want to get work done. For example each member of the group comminicates with each other and work gets done faster. Communication helps in different ways,helping someone if they don't understand something,Giving advice to another student if they feel like they are stuck or need a different opinnion or not agreeing with someone else there's always a different way to communicate that to each other. communication is key to work in groups.

Working in groups benefits one another by working faster, communicating with each other, helping each other out when someone is not understanding something and giving different ideas. Working in groups can be helpfull if students know how to use it and take advantage of the opportunnity. It should be the best way to get work done and be able to help each other out.

3100,DBC8CBF56BB9,"As a child, I always loved to go to the park. It was my favorite thing to do because I loved playing games with my sisters and sometimes we'd even make up our own game to play. However, things have changed in the past few years and now I barely ever go to the park. The park isn't the same fun and cool place that it used to be anymore, but why?, Why did it change so quickly?.

There are so many reasons to why the park hasn't been visited as much as before, but, yet again only one reason explains why most people barely ever go to the park. The reason for why people never to go the park now is because they don't know what to do at the park anymore. People think that the park is a boring and useless place, but the park have many purposes. People now spend more time on their couch and on their phone and it's very unhealthy and concerning especially when it comes to health issues in the future. The park is a fun and entertaining place to be because there are millions of activities that you could do at the park that are very enjoyable. I'm going to list a wide variety of fun and entertaining activities.

First off, you could always go the park with friends and/or family members. It's always great to be around the people you enjoy the most, especially in a beautiful environment like the park, where everyone could enjoy themselves. Second, you could always head to the park for some quick exercise. You could run, jog, do yoga and much more when you're at the park. It's always a good idea to clear your mind and go for a run at the park when it's beautiful outside. It's always important to make sure your health is in good condition and you can make sure that happens by taking a walk at the park. The third activity is, play some fun games at the park!. When your at the park you could always play some fun games that get you pumped up and happy. With the nice, fresh, open space that is available, the possibilities are endless!. You could make up your own fun games with your friends or family members. Now my fourth fun activity is, throwing a fun party!. It could be a birthday, graduation or even a going-away party, The occasion doesn't matter at all!. Having a nice party at the park is one of the funnest things!. You could do a barbecue and play with your friends and/or family members. celebrating outdoors is a great way to have a blast. My fifth activity is, help clean the park. This activity might sound really boring but helping our your community is 100% worth all of your time. When helping out your community you're not only helping those around you but you're helping yourself, the environment and the animals. Many animals live in parks, for example. a squirrel , birds, worms and even small insects. So next time you go to the park, or are planning to go, make sure you at least pick up one piece of trash, because that small piece of trash could save the animals and the environment.

Now my last but certainly not least reason is, grab a book and head to the park and read. This might seem like boring stacked on top of boring but doing this helps you clam down and relax a lot. When you're in a beautiful and peaceful environment, how could you be mad?.

Why should you try one of these activities?. These activities aren't only fun but they do help you in the long run. Hanging out with your friends and family members help you appreciate the people in your lives but also the environment that it giving access to being able to be around people. Taking a nice run at the park helps you by being healthy and improving your well being. Exercising doesn't have to mean running and jogging, it could be yoga too. Making up your own games help you build up your mind especially when you have access to so much space, you can pretty much create a fun and entertaining game. Reading a book is one of the most important things that you have to do in order to build up a stronger brain and doing to it in a peaceful, quite and beautiful environment makes the experience 100x more pleasing. You don't have to choose one of my ideas, you can choose and make up your own activities!. So next time you go to your local park, make sure you contribute and acknowledge the beauty of your community and make sure it's being properly taken care of.",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.8,2
2681,C616CFDBCA6A,"Online courses and receiving your education at home can be beneficial in many ways due to the fact that you're technically not in ""school"" for seven hours a day learning. For this very reason, being home schooled and having online courses gives you the chance to have more time to do your work, reevaluate, and overall to take as long as you may need, and whats important is feeling comfortable and moving at your own pace.

Although, some may take this as an advantage or opportunity to try and fit in extracurricular activities and or to try and learn new things because maybe they want to pursue something different that needs more time of something and less time of a seven hour education course that restricts them of doing so because school takes up almost of half of the time in their every day life.

Online classes can often help people but make it harder for other people to learn, sometimes you'll need a buddy to help out or you'll need a teacher to ask questions to learn but people may take online courses because they feel that they can work better alone rather than to be working with others and thats where they could be in the wrong.

You're not always going to know everything, you have to give yourself the chance to open up and have the opportunity so that you could expand your knowledge of education, there's a point in time where you've got to say ask a classmate or teacher for help, and Im not speaking on the behalf of everyone but thats how people are, they think they can learn everything there is to know about something but you've got to take a step back and know when to say hey and say these five simple words and that is, ""may I get help please"".

Therefore I do Indeed agree that taking online classes is a great way to benefit off of beacause people may feel that they can work on their own and move at their own pace and overall just have an amazing experience at the end of the day.       ",4.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.3,2
2188,A366CC7B0D05,"Are first impressions impossible to change? No, I believe that first impressions are not impossible to change because when you typically meet someone for the first time many people just try to "" fit in "" or be someone who they really aren't but within time the perspective of how you are viewed can be changed and the first impression you made of yourself the first time won't matter. Also, when you first meet someone , typically you are nerves and you can be seen as a quiet and closed person when in reality you are really outgoing but it just takes you time to adapt to someone and many people don't act like themselfs.

A example of why I disagree with ""first impressions being hard to change"" is because the first time I met my boyfriends mom I was really shy and nerves and I thought was giving off a bad vibe and making myself look "" bored "" even though I was just trying to be careful and not seem so crazy with what I said or did. After a while of me being around her she started to see me as a different person/much better person than i was and she started to see how outgoing I was and how I was nothing like the first impression I gave her and her view of me changed.

Another example I have of how first impression can be changed is the from the first time i met one of my best friends. I first met her through a mutual friend we both had and when we got introduced to each other i thought she was annoying and that she could never be serious but with the time that went by I started to see how she really was and that was her personality and maybe i judged to fast. So when we started to become closer friends my first impression of her changed because now i love her and the first impression of her didn't affect me after all.

So in conclusion , no , I don't think first impressions are almost hard to change. But it is also not something that can be changed within hours but with time the impression you give off can definitely be changed for the better or for the worse based on your actions as well.",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.7,2
286,1535E922B3AA,"One topic that is frequently debated today is that to conserve energy and resources, some businesses have adopted a four_day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. people is discussing if school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours.

Some people think that this is not a good idea because if that happened students, teachers, and all staff would work more and they are going to get tired more easily. And these four days would be consider more longer than five normal days, Also maybe school would required more things to graduate and to complete these requirements it would take more time Also people think that school should have any other ideas to conserve energy without changing the days of school. for example: turn off lights when we do not need it, open the Windows etc..

I think that extending school two more hours would be very difficult for us because almost all the students have to work after school and some have full time and that required to work more that four days so if school is more long we would not complete with our jobs. And i think that if we use the energy how we have to, that would make a big difference. Also i think that if we get opinions from other people outside of the school we would have more good ideas of what to do to conserve all energy.

I believe that study just four days should be more difficult to learn we probably get more easily tired because would be ten hours each day And and if we see and think if school is only four days we have to wake up more early and go home more tardy and actually the energy would be the same amount as five days there is just a little difference between five to four days of school. Also if we get tired maybe i think would be more difficult to learn.

Finally to decided the best solution we need to give our opinion and discuss it. And I believe that more than one student need more time than others to learn because in my experience is really really hard to learn new things,

new units, new information, and if we have only four day it make more difficult for many students. Also as we see, there is many ideas to conserve energy and very easy to catch up like in the first paragraph there are two very useful ideas how to conserve the energy, without taking away any day.",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,2
265,1348668DF845,"Is it a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early?

School districts programs would be making a big mistake on allowing high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional 4 years.

If they allow high school students to graduate in three years , they would be making everything harder in the Generic_School because students would have to put more effort than ever on passing their classes and the SOL.

In any other state would agree on graduating high school students in 3 years because their rules are different from the the state of Virginia, For example, in Virginia high school students are required to have their SOL passed with more than 400 points, and the 22 Credits instead of graduating for high school.

Other states like Kentucky or Chicago will agree to this because they are required to have 22 credits for their graduation , and it would not be that hard to get 22 credits in 3 years.

It would be a a bad idea to allow students to graduate in 3 years instead of 4 because students would not like to come back to school in summer to do more work, get the credits they need, and make the SOL , as a student i would not like that to happen because we would not get a lot of time for vacations in summer to spend with my family, and i would not like to take courses during the evening , it would be like to be doing a lot of extra work.

People in different states would like to allow this new rule of graduating high school students in 3 years because they can prepare them more everyday doing their work so they can graduate faster in 3 years .

Many other people are saying that it would be better for them to graduate high school students in 4 years because students would be having a lot more of time to get prepare for college and for try to pass whatever they need for graduation.

183,0E03218FDD2F,"Educators say that students should have shorter breaks because, students don't retain information as easily when they return, its better if students spend more time in school rather than taking long breaks, summer breaks are better when they are shorter. Some students say having long breaks gives them time to relax and not having to worry about school for a couple of weeks is a good thing. One day on my summer break me and my friends were discussing on how much we love our long summer breaks. We also realized that having a long summer break is only fair because we spend so many hours in school everyday.

Summer breaks are better when they are shorter because, students dont forget as much information that they learned during school. Its better to come back and still remember the stuff you learned. Just imagine coming back after a 5 week break, I doubt students would be able to take a test right away. We need shorter breaks because if students spend to much time away from school they'll forget the important things they've learned. Students should consider spending more time in school rather than spending all there time on their breaks.

Spending more time in school is more important than spending longer weeks out of school not learning anything. Students must realize that their education is more important than spending time off of school. School teaches us what we need to know for the future, it prepares us for the next stage of life. They need to realize that they need to learn us much as they can, the more effort put into school work and learning the better the outcome. Life shows us that you can't just get a job without knowing anything, you can't sign up if you don't know your basic math or basic reading. Some students think school is a waste of time but honestly it's preparing us for the stuff we need to know.

Students do not retain information as easily when they return. Those long breaks really take a toll on the students, they return to school and don't have a clue on how to solve a basic problem. The more time students have out of school the more it drains their memory on what they've learned. Coming back on an empty brain not knowing anything isn't good at all because what if a student had an exam on the day he or she returned, do you think they'd pass? Having a shorter break would improve a lot of things.

In conclusion, it'd be so much better if breaks were shorter than they usually are. Students would be able to come back and easily answer a question and get it right. The less time on break the better, school should be the main priority for students. Im sure that some of the students would love to pass their classes. Overall we know that having a shorter break would improve the learning skill for all students. I agree that our breaks should be shorter so we could stay on track and keep p our good work.

It has been said that 1st Impressions are almost impossible to change. This statement to me is wrong. Impressions can be changed not only because people always mature in life, but also people may change by others actions, and they way life treats one another.

Impressions can be changed because people mature in life. For example, my mother tells me all the time that I was not the same kid she raised because of my appearance and the way I act around others. So, it is because I have matured that I have changed, if I was 7 or 8 years old, I would be shay to talk to people and try to be polite to not cause problems. Also, people would never smoke or even talk back if their impressions matter like they did when they were little. So peoples impressions change when you get mature in life

Impressions can be changed because of the people around them. For example, my little brother may not do all the things that he does now if it weren't for my behavior around others, back then my little brother would be very shay to speak. Then he saw how I spoke to others; with security, courage, and calm. He learned that from me and now he talks to anyone he enjoys hanging out with. So, with people being and influence in someones life, you would make a good or a bad impacted on someone's life which would change someone's impression for sure.

Impressions can be changed because the way life treats one another. For example, a week from my birthday I was going to turn 14 my dad got arrested; I did not feel like I wanted to throw a party, I hated everything cause I said to my self life isn't fair, Then the next morning in school, every ones impression of was that I never felt sad, I was a happy young teen; Until the next day everyone was wishing me a happy early birthday. I didn't feel happy about it because my mind was all caught up on my fathers arrest. People noticed that and their impression changed because I never felt happy in my life, everything went wrong. Instead of everyone greeting me every morning, they just gave me space because they thought that I was depressed and I was for a good time. Now people take me seriously now because I didnt make jokes. So peoples impression changes ever since they saw the way life wasn't fair.

In conclusion, It has been said that 1st Impressions are almost impossible to change. This statement to me is wrong. Impressions can be changed not only because people always mature in life, but also people may change by others actions, and they way life treats one another. All of these reasons are true because no one really knows what life, maturity, and the people around you can do to affect someone's 1st impressions of you.",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.6,2
3197,E07F7A913FB6,"A football manager OleGunnar Solksajer once said ""Prasing his players and kids helps them work to the best of their ability"". That is a very significant statement because every student have their own set of skills and abilities. Some students are good in sports,math,science,art or music. However, plenty of students are not able to perform to the best of their ability because they have low self-confidence which is mainly caused by the lack of praise and incentive by their parents,teachers or coaches. Praising a student's work is important because it helps build their confidence and motivates them to work harder.

Praising a student's work is vital for their productivity because it builds their confidence. Studies show that people with high self-confidence are usually risk takers,creative,optimistic,hardworking and productive. This shows how important it is for teachers and parents to praise their students. Self-confidence is not something that happens suddenly, it is a process that builds up from a young age. Little praises and incentives from parents and teachers are not only important for the students' performance in school but also when they transform into adults.

Additionally, another importance of praising students is the motivation for them to work harder. Students always seem to work harder when they get an incentive or praise. That is because students feel appreciated for their work and it also make them feel like they are doing a good job so they always stay motivated to do better every time. Motivation is vital for everyone because its as important as an oil is for a car. Motivation is a motor that keeps the sudents happy and hopeful. Motivated students always work hard and give their best effort.

There are some people that think praising students will undrmine learning by lowering standards and some believe a true self-esteem and confidence comes from achievment and not from prasing. Although it's a fair opinion, it is wrong because students who get praise from teachers and parents always seem to do better acadamically and in outside-school activities. In conclusion, Praising a student's work is very important because it helps build their confidence and motivates them to work harder and smarter.",4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.2,2

We have heard stories of so many different people who have stood out on their field; celebrities, journalists, corporation leaders, etecetera. What do all of these people have in common? They never backed down from their dreams and took every step in their life in action towards that dream. People like Steve Jobs could've stayed in the comfort of their homes, idle, to the outside world and the possibilities that they had to create something that would transcendentaly change the world. But they decided otherwise, because of their denial to idealness they shaped and transformed the 21st century world as we know it. All the people who we remember and our taught about in our history classes, decided to live their lifes taking action to make a change.

But many times we don't have a goal to find the motivation to take action towards our life. It should be reminded that the actions we take don't have to be for our own desires. Instead taking action and denying to be ideal allows us the possibility of one of the greatest sources of happiness: service to others. We are constantly battered by a world that seems more disastrious everyday, everytime we watch the news we seem to be living in world full of lies and grief. Where innocent people suffer the consequences of actions that are not their own. By denying to idleness and reflecting about the world we live in, we allow ourselves to create an impact on other people's lives. Spreading joy and happiness and making a mark on their lives. While also creating happiness and fulfillment in our own lives.

Perhaps a more gruesome but at the same time important way to analyze the denial to idleness is asking ourselves these questions: ""When I leave this earth, what do I want to leave behind?"""" What do I want my legacy to be?"". Hopefully your answer isn't nothing. Because wether we believe it ourselves or not we all have the capacity, capability, and opportunity to leave a legacy that we are proud of. We are all the determinants of our legacy. Wether it be something of large scale involving the whole world or something related to your best friend. We are all most likely to want for people to remember us. Perhaps it's something chemical in our brains that makes us want this or perhaps we want to know that the time we spent on Earth was of some value. Perhaps in our last hours of living we want the reassurance of this very thing. And the only way to know that we will feel that satisfaction is by taking action today, no matter where you are or what you're doing. After all when people were asked in their last hours of living what do they regret doing, they said that they do not regret doing anything, that insted they regretted not doing the things they could've done. Taking action is the way to leave footprints on this earth, by taking steps forwards, backwards, to the right and left. And perhaps more than one of those steps will be facing the wrong direction but it's important to remind ourselves that we have to keep walking because that's the only way we will realize how much we can accomplish.

Taking action in your everyday lfe and the denial of idleness allows you the possibility to create the world you once thought you could only imagine. By stepping out and seeing what life has to offer wether that be a flower or a river, it is what allows us to accomplish our goals. And the denial of idleness helps you realize that there's people out there who want your joy put out on this world. So my last question to you is: When you wake up tomorrow, will you take a step forward?",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.6,2

My most important reason why I agree for students to commit to a career because ,It gives a sense of direction to our life by giving life a purpose worth fulfilling. Achieving career of satisfaction to us It also helps us attain certain status in life and society.

3845,FD7DC289E98E,"Many students involve themselves in a lot of school activities to enrich their educational experience, some Students can also learn responsibility, because the students can choose how many activities they would like to do.

The students could also feel more mature by having to talk with their parents to do any activity after school. Students also have the opportunity to make lots of friends by joining clubs or doing sports.

Although if the school controlled the students involvement of doing any activity, the students would have a limit of joining a certain amount of activities after school. That could help the student not stress about all the responsibility they would have to do. The school also makes students have good grades in other to join a club or sport, which helps the students focus on school assignments first. However letting the school control a student, would make the student struggle with responsibility and communication with people.

If a student wants to play a sport and be in a club after school because the student wants to make friends, they shouldn't be limited to joining just one by the school. Instead the student should be allowed to choice and join as many clubs or sports they would like. It would help the student to communicate with people without them being scared or shy to talk to someone. Going out of their comfort zone early would also help a student with finding and working for a job. Communication is one of the most important things in a daily life, and if a student can't join an activity because of their grades, how would the student be able to talk to someone if their scared too.

Joining a lot of activities after school, helps a student with responsibility. When a student is involved in a lot of activities, they learns to use their time wisely and would help them later in life for when they are working. It would also help with daily events like taking out the trash, washing their dishes, cleaning their room, and doing their school assignments. Since they have to be doing well in school to even be doing after school activities. Responsibility is something a student should learn in a early age, and should have during school and after they graduate from high school and even collage.

If a student is committed to doing all the activities they chose to have, they will do great. Not only will they feel good about themselves, but that will make their parents proud and show them that they ready to be independent. That would also look good for when the student signs up for a collage they would like to go to, but also for when they get a job. When someone is committed to their job, their boss will notice that they really wanna work and could even get a raise. Commitment will help a student, because if they believe they can do a lot of school work and do lots of activities, They will feel great about themselves at the end of their high school career.

well, some friendships are made by internet, outside activities, and others by being neighbors for a long time, however, the most lasting and common friendships are the ones you made at school. Therefore, you spend hours, days, months, and years being socially with the people around you, but what if you don't want to attend to school, and decide to take classes from home?

At school, you don't only made friends and memories , you also earn and learn good advices, and you see different perspectives.

People who are not socialist tend to be ones who graduated by taking online classes; they don't know how to interact with people, because they had spent most of their life talking and interacting with their computers. Sometimes we are the cause why people rather to take online classes, we separate them by diseases, illness and mental problems, not a lot of students at school have the chance to receive help or talk with their counselor ; this is one of the reasons why people doesn't want to attend to school, and choose online classes.

A lot of cases now days about why people decide to course home school are:

Pregnancy at early age: The girls who get pregnant while they are in High School either take home school or don't go study anymore, when their belly starts growing they feel ashamed, and they tend to quit school.

The Life of Generic_Name, a 17 years old High School student , who migrate 2 years ago from Guatemala. Generic_Name's teacher was talking about the online courses, home school and other online options, in order that Generic_Name can graduate on time, she was so excited about her graduation date. She had a problem if for some reasons she decided to take the online course to finish High School on time; she couldn't speak English. So, how could Generic_Name learn to speak English, sitting all day long in front of her computer?

This is an example of a problem that many students had to face, when they are forced to do home school.

In conclusion, students won't benefit by attending classes from home, here is one the reasons why ; I am a student and sometimes I don't do the work that my teachers assign me, knowing so well, my teacher can walk where I am sitting and ask me for the assign work. So, can you imagine the online courses, students can search their answers, be on their phones, or taking care of someone while they are taking the online class, so much distraction.

2207,A4A90A401002,"People who value self-reliance define it as the need for each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas.

This is reasonable for each individual, and people should make their own decisions in life. We always ran into problems and sometimes we need to make decisions on our own.

When we have the choice and decide to make the differences, it's important to follow our instincts and we have to take the responsibility to make the good choice. This is how we learn by ourselves.

In our daily life, people always ran into problems and get stressed out, for example, the car broke down in the middle of the traffic, failing the test that you've been studying for weeks, your boss fired me today...

However, it is our choice to make the right decision and to change it; you could call for help from someone, you can study harder or ask others to help on the school work, and also look into other jobs that you are interested in.

There are so many options for everyone to pick and to follow our own instincts and ideas to make everything better.

As an adult, soon after high school I will be joining navy and have my own life, to do everything by myself.

Everything around me will change completely,I will not have my parents standing beside me to teach me common sense, nor my teachers to teach me about life lessons, nor any of my friends to be there and help me out, this is all about me and my decision to make.

If I'm going to learn the hard way, I will have to learn the hard way.

Maybe my instincts kick in and help me out, you never know.

Making your own judgment is one of the most important survival skills we will have to learn in life, everyone will grow up one day, to have your own family and all the responsibilities, now you are the one who have to decide everything, to have responsibility for not only yourself but you family as well.

Instincts will tell you which way your heart goes, and sometimes it might leads you to the wrong path, but don't worry, this is how we are going to learn.

Success is not an easy path, it's full of adventure and false on the way to finish.

You will experience more fail than you can ever imagine before you achieve the goal, to success it all by yourself is to follow your instincts and ideas.

You may have concerns that what if you seek guidance for experts and authorities about life's important matters?

Guess what, life is full of adventure, you never going to know what is coming next and not everyone's life is going to be the same, so therefore seek guidance for experts may work for some people, not all, you may have found a different solution for yourself.

All we can do is listen what others advises are, Because you will be the one who make the final decision, and you are responsible to your decision, not anybody's advice or common.

Everything is on you and to follow your heart to make things right, or to learn how to judge then choose the right path.

No one will change your life unless you let it happen, no one can change your final decision unless you don't follow your instincts and heart.

This is why we should make our own decisions, not only to make things right, but also follow your heart and to understand about life's important matters.",3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.6,2
2747,CA11FD3CAC43,"Many people have been told about the fact that the students should know the career they want in high school and learn about it. Therefore, many societies around the world, are expect to provide help to the students to find the career they want to study by the time they enter high school. In fact, many schools select the courses for the students based on the career the students choose. In addition, many schools think that the students should be young when they think about the career they want, just to make sure that they will not change their minds in the future. So, it is a good idea to commit to a career at a young age.

Based on that, students will have time to prepare themselves to be ready for the career they choose. Students will be able to make sure that the career they choose is good for them. If students are prepare at a young age for the career they want, then they will be able to enjoy it. For example, I want to study interior design, therefore, I have to take art classes to learn about colors and how to combine them. If students choose their career at a young age, they will be more prepare and have better results while complete their life goals, because life goals are very importat to have a good life's quality.

Also, students will be able to see if they like the career they choose. It should be a good idea for students to know themselves and what they like, because it is unpleasant when a person have to study what the parents want him or her to study just because they could not have done what they wanted to do. So if the schools support students to find the perfect career for them, then this disagreeable situation will stop. In many cases, people that had to choose a wrong career have to deal with a unhappy life, because they do not feel well in their jobs. Once again, if students have the school's support, they will be able to find the perfect career for them.

In addition, students will learn about the career and how it works. It might not be noticeable for people the fact that nothing is how it seems, some careers might seem to be easy and be hard, or the opposit, the career might seem to be hard and be really easy. For example, it is easy to judge a lawyer when he do not win a case, but we have no idea how hard the work he did can be. In my 19 years in this world, I learned that nothing is as easy as we want it to be, but if we search information about what we want to do for life, we will be happier, that is a fact. Schools should require an essay in which students can write about what they like and what skills they have.

So, students should know what they want and what they are good in. If students learn about the career they want they will have the opportunity to be great professionals. If the students start learning about the career they want at a young age, then they will have plenty of time to prepare themselves mental and phisically for their future career. Also, students will be able to see if they like the career they choose so they do not regret it in the future. And last but not least, students will have time to learn how the careers work, so they will have many ideas of how to complete them.

Have you thought of set an example for your own behavior?

Albert Schweitzer said ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" Setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence other people.

However; others believe that their are better ways to influence others because the person being influenced should set their own examples not everyone wants to follow someone examples.

Although not everyone thinks the same it's better to set an example by your own behavior to influence others. People get influenced by demonstrations, peoples mistakes and when visualizing things.

To influence someone you have to set an example for them to visualize what you are trying to influence them to do. Most people get influence when presented demonstrations through videos, presentations and pictures. My favorite youtubers influence me by spreading postivity through their videos and content. They help the homeless by providing them shelter; they make people's day by helping them with their needs. They influence me to want to help the homeless and other people. These youtubers Influence their subscribers to spread posivity throughout the world by the examples they set on their videos.

A lot of people learn from others mistakes; setting a good example from your own behavior will influence others not to do your mistake in your example because they will take it into concerdation. One of my friends told me their experience on missing their opportunity of taking a course required for graduation. She did not get to graduate on time she stayed one more year in high school to complete the course she missed. She regretted not taking the course her junior year to graduate on time. My friend influenced me to take the class my junior year and to learn from her mistakes. I didn't miss my opportunity I got to take the course and earned the credit for it. I learned from her example she influenced me by telling me to follow her example to accomplish it.

Most people don't believe things until they see an example of things. They're are people that need to visualize things to get influenced by them. It's confirmed that most influencers present things that you can visualize to influence people. I am a person that needs to see an example of something in order to believe it. When I am searching information I need to see if it is fiction or non fiction. Once I researched up the wrong information for a presentation the article didn't state a true event. I got a bad grade for the presentation as my consequence I had an F that quarter for not stating a true fact. Influencers set example's of their own behavior to influence you the right way.

Others believe that there are better ways to influence others by letting the person being influenced set their own example. The person being influenced can not set their own examples if they don't have experience. People need to follow someone example because they need to be influenced before they can influence others by setting their own examples. All influencers have been influenced by others examples they didn't set their own example.

Following an influencers example will help the person being influenced learn from their mistakes and improve from them to set better examples to others being influenced.

Albert schweitzer set his own examples from his own behavior to influence others. He was

Inspired by other influencers examples and that it was the only thing to help influence others.

He says that the best way to influence other people is to set a good example by your own behavior. You should follow someone examples by their own behavior to set a good example to influence others.

3464,ED0A8E614649,"Techonology has becoming powerful that let students and teachers to give and receive classes online. Disadvantages or adventages of taking classes online? These question are faced today by students deciding taking online classes. Often students work part or full time jobs while going to school or collage so their time is valuable. these students want to make the right decisions in choosing classes so knowing the disaventage and adventages is important. I believe that online classes is a good opportunity for students as it gives flexibility, they often offer any type of class desired and provide access to faculty, and they often offer accelerate courses.

To begin with, one of the best adventage of online classes is flexibility. A student can usually take the course any time during the day or week. While there are custom essay writing and researching assigments to complete, the precise time to take the class often depends on the student's desire. Students who work are able to take the class based on their schedule. Many students work on afternoon. The flexibility makes it possible for a person to complete the course, while attending school or collage courses in person might be imposible due to their work schedules.

Secondly, another great adventage of online courses is that almost any type of course can be found online. Distance learning course are often avaliable from a number of collages. A person can simply use the google to find a class. While most people believe a disadventage of taking online courses is that the students can not have access to faculty a member, the fact is that many online courses offer a grater access to faculty. Shy students are able to ask questons and receive the answer back almost inmediately.

Lastly, Online courses are convenient for most undergraduate and graduate students who can study when they want and they can finish writing or researching assigments based on their own person schedules. The fact is online classes offer flexibility and conveniece that are often vital to students who work and have families. In addition, many students are looking for classes that are advanced to complete the course faster. The best way to advance in the class is to make it online because in the regular schools it takes a long time as there are students who get behind and the teachers wait for them since everyone has to go at the same time.

To conclude, with online classes, students do all the work at their own pace. As long as they meet their deadlines and participate apropriately online. Also, studying online requires more self motivation and time mangement skills because students will spend a lot of time on their own without someone physically close to keep them focused on deadlines. Online course will not only teach students geology or poetry, it will also help them become more self motivated, a trait that will make them stand out in the workplace and beyond. It will teach educators to be mature choosing right decisions as it will make them explore more and be students with an open mind.         ",4.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.9,2
2318,ACA1A45EE438,"I strongly disagree with extending the school days. Longer school days can have a great impact on students. It also makes class hours long. Most students likes to have short classes. Longer school days can make students, exhausted, have less free time, and hate school. Longer school days will not make students happy.

Longer school days can make students exhausted. Longer school day causes the classes to be longer. Which most students get tired of being in the same class for a long time. Students get tired of doing a lot of work in class which make them want to do less work. Students will be exhausted which will make them not go outside.

By extending school days students will not have free time. Most students like to spend time with their family and friends. However, longer school days can take that privilege away. Longer school days can take away students free time. Most of the year it can get dark outside early, and students won't be able to go outside after they come from school. Since students won't have enough free time to go outside they will hate going to school.

Students will hate going to school when there is longer school days. Because students like to have less class time. Also students would want to do less work. Students wouldn't want to be in their least favorite class for a long time. If the school hours get longer students would not want to come to school. Also some students would skip the classes they didn't like.

By adding hours to the school days students will be, tired, they won't be able to have free time, and they will not want to be at school. Students will hate school if the hours get longer. Students will not enjoy school. Also classes would have a lot of work in one day which would make them not want to come to school.
