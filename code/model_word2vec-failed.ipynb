People are afraid to make their own choice because they don't want to get rejected or be wrong. In this world, most of the teenagers act and follow the people who are strong and bullies.

Personally when I came to the United States I used to follow other, because I thought they were amazing. But one day, I knew I was walking in the wrong path and I left them. Making your own choices makes you happy because you get to do what you like and what you want to do. It's hard to make your own choices, but one day you're going to have to make your own choices.

As the influencer having people look up to you and following the way you move is a big deal. For example when surgical interns first go to a hospital to work they look up to their head surgeons. The head surgeons set examples for the interns because they want them to be successful, the intern watching the head surgeon during operations and check ups influences and motivates them to do better and be better.

If adults could just put more trust in teens i think it would improve kids behavior and also have kids get to prove them self to show how responsible they can be. teens are more responsible than everyone might think, I think they just need a chance to prove it to everyone.

You need imagination in order to make new things. Another example would be the camera.

You can't picture it, you just know the definitions. Another example is when reading a book. Knowing how to read isn't even near of what you need to fully comprehend a book. You need to imagine it.

In my opinion student's should not be required to take arts classes because they might need other class. First some students might want to boost there GPA so they have a better chance of getting into the college they want to go too. Also students might need to get the extra support they need to pass in their classes. The class work might be a little difficult for the student who might not understand what is going on in the class room, so they might need more support in class insted of taking arts classes. students need to improve on there grads or get extra help and should not take arts classes. Secondly Students have outside responsibility out of school like a job and sometimes when you have a job your boss might call you and say can you cover someones shift and your boss tells you to come in and you have to be there on time and the student has to leave early or not come to school at all, or a student has to pick there little borther or sister from school or daycare. Thirdly Some students are artistic and they want to be in arts classes like dram, art, music and enjoy doing art classes but all students are not artistic some students are shy or could get panic attacks they prefer to in a extra class or in study hall. In conclusion I think that arts classes should not be a requirement for graduation because students want to get there work done, get extra help to understand their class work or they may have a job they need to get go for and need to leave early and students are not artistic.\",\n",

       " ['I would agree with being honest at all times because if I\\'am honest, I\\'am telling the truth and I\\'m not lying towards anyone. The reason why being honest is the best policy is that people can really trust me if they ask me a question or if I need their help with any of my work even if they are not honest or completely honest with any of their work. I think that honesty would be number one in my personality because people get smarter when they grow and honesty will be in my life mostly from the start. Another reason why honesty is very important in my life would be to believe that I\\'m not going to fail a test or I won\\'t get bullied in the future. But sometimes honesty would fail and some people are going to get angry with me when they actually trusted me. Then they might have learned a lesson to not trust me in their entire life ever again. That would be sad if I said I were honest that this would happen and I was actually positive about it just to make my friend or my family member happy instead of thinking about all the negative things that are going to happen which actually might have a tiny chance to happen or not happen. After a negative relationship about honesty happens with my friend or family member, they would disagree on my honesty and might never trust me again and find someone smarter than me. Later in my life, my friend or family member might apologize to me when they could not trust me in the past. The relationship with my family member or friend might come back together again and they might agree with my honesty once again and we might never get into a fight about honesty and relationships ever again. But what if my friend or family member found more than one person besides me to trust in their honesty. We might have a huge debate going on about that and also get into a fight that would never stop. It would be best to not have a huge argument about honesty and I can meet with the other person face to face and have a conversation with them which is not that harmful and nobody will hurt anyone\\'s feelings or my friend or family member would not allow me to be with them their entire life anymore. That would be better because it would be best to gather as many people as I know because then me and other people who are very good with honesty can help my friends and my family members stop thinking about negative relationships and we can make them think about positive relationships so they won\\'t get stressed out or they won\\'t have any attacks when they think about anything that makes them feel sad or other dangerous thoughts like suicidal thoughts, dying by doing drugs, getting into a car crash etc. Even if someone tells me that they cannot trust me and they disagree with my honesty, I don\\'t have any dangerous thoughts about death. I will fight back for my position in honesty even if many people trusted my honesty and I failed them in my honesty. Still, my honesty is not a failure. I will be honest my entire life and I will never lose my most important personality about me which is honesty. If I think I\\'m going to fail a test on the first attempt. I\\'m always honest that I will not fail this test today and I\\'m going to try so hard on this test that I pass and I will win and be happy with my own honesty that I trust. Sometimes if I forget to study for a test, it\\'s not honesty\\'s fault I failed. It\\'s my fault I did not study for the test because most of the answers I got wrong in the test is because I guessed instead of knowing the correct answer. If I can\\'t trust honesty or if I don\\'t need it now. I\\'ll use my honesty if I really need it help me succeed so I won\\'t be a failure in life. I would want everyone to have honesty as their number one personality because honesty can really help everyone solve many conflicts that are not easy to solve in one attempt and I might need help with it. Most people disagree with being honest at all times and they say it\\'s not their number one personality because people first have to learn the true meaning of honesty and how it can actually help me succeed in your life. Most of the time, people think that very smart people have the best honesty and they might agree with their honesty for some reason. But they\\'re wrong, I can trust everyone\\'s honesty. It\\'s not like people who are not smart don\\'t have the best honesty and people who are smart have the best honesty, they\\'re equal. People who are not that smart can grow in the future and their honesty can lead to many people supporting someone who was not smart in the past and is now smart in the future. Same with smart people, they can either continue to grow or their smartness has a tiny chance of dropping. Then people in the future for some reason would continue to trust smart people even if I know that their smartness and their true honesty has dropped which would mean that they started to lie in the future and in the past they would tell the truth. That would be the reason why smart people in the past might start to lie about most of their things in the future if nobody teaches them to never get into the non honesty mode. The right people that can reteach me about honesty if you lose it would be either your family members or teachers because you don\\'t goof around with my family and my teachers that often, it\\'s mainly with my friends because they can try to get me into a different world to forget about honesty and everyone will wonder what happened with being honest and why can\\'t they trust me anymore. Same with people who grow, my friends and family members will be suprised how I learned to be honest and how most people can trust me now. They would be put in a totally different world and they would be thinking. \"How did they change in the future?\" \"I thought they would still be the same their entire life?\" Finally, once they figured out how I changed in the future. They will probably inform everyone about the person that has changed. That is why honesty is number one for everyone lives and it\\'s best.',\n",

My first reason, is because a lot of kids who have good grades such as B\\' s and A\\' s they don\\'t get as distracted in school. Therefore, they will be focused better in their activity, and not in doing something like homework. People who have C\\' s, D\\' s , and F\\' s they will not be focused in the sports activity because they have to worry about doing homework and getting their grades up. Because they are responsible for having bad grades they shouldn\\'t participate in school activities. Maybe you ask \"What if someone has the potential in playing but doesn\\'t have the grades\". Its probably because they get to distracted, in playing sports and not doing their work. Kids who have bad grades tend to be lazy, and if we let them be on the team how can we expect to win if one of the members is not even participating. Another reason why, you should have good grades and be able to participate in activities is because it will look good when you go to college. There are more chances for you to get into a better college that you will like. And when you get a job you will get a well paying job. In conclusion, that is why I think the principal shouldn\\'t let students who have a lower than a C average participate in school sports activities. One because they are lazy, and not well focused in school. I think it will be way better if kids who have good grades get the credit for participating in both sports and class work. These are my reasons why I think students who have B average should be involved in school activities and kids who have a C average shouldn\\'t.      ',\n",

When more people come in to the USA then people or trying to stop it and not focusing on the students and staff that want help when in need. When people do their taxes the money goes to helping solve the problem so people should do their taxes to help solve the problem faster so kids can have go learning environment. The more the President wants to work on trying to get a imagination law to be made he should be focusing on the over things he ran for president not just one thing for years. The President should work on helping the people in need like sick people or the homeless and trying to help the homeless buy or get a small home to be safe in in so they can survive in the cold days and be clean and healthy. I mean having knowledge is good to get the job you wanted since you were a kid but i say it\\'s better to work on imagination while working on helping people in need.

If he doesnt like it how it runs he'll tell you so he wont do the mistake he did. Always ask someone that had the things you want and ask them how it is so you dont mess up. Always ask for advise from people with expreience because they know what their talking about.

So that spead germs through out the school and causes major illness. Spreading germs can have someone hospitalized and in bad condition. Which can make students have bad attendince. Also parents would loose jobs to attend to their sick child. However staying home and still be able to do your school work causes less stress. Because it gives student more time to be able to complete there assignments. Another reason way online classes will help out students that are in wheel chairs, crutches, and broken legs. Is they dont have to be rushed, pushed, in the crowded halls. Therefore they feel more safe and have enough space at home. Parents will be able to supervise their child more. An not be worried that something else might happen. Health issues should be a cause of not being able to not attend school if you are able to do it from home.',\n",

An some can understand the content off the first try. Also some student need to see it hands on then be supervised as they complete the task. Witch is also not a bad way to retain information. If help is needed the video conferencing will help out in the long run. Being able to home relax and still manage to completed your school work motivates the student to remain on task. Another reason why is grades will have a major increase and students would maintain a higher grade point average. The best part of the video conferencing is the student will be able to replay it if needed. Instead of hearig it once in class from a teacher then forgetting the information the next time you have that subject. Apart of life that is important to have is knowledge, so being able to teach and perfect your weakness are important.\",\n",

Most students are not responsible to wake up on time to catch the bus. The students that walk are stessed, because they have to walk while its raining, hot, ride their bike, cold, and dark. In conditions like that are not safe for students to go through is something happend to them. Most of the time parents have to work and be worried that their child get to school safe. Having the privaledge to be home and do work will prevent fights, childish students, and angery teachers. So everyone would have peace and respect for one another and learn more.

I agree with Michelangelo that you dont need to be the best as long as you put effort in to it you can do anything but at the same time i disagree with this quotes because you dont need your setting to be low it can be high at the same time it really doesnt matter how you can achieve your mark no matter what way or path you decide to take life take to different place makes you do different decides. For example right now am doing a sol if i aim to high in order to pass and reach 12th grade and to get my diploma my aim can a low and i can still have a achieve my mark .

What can change us can be the people around us, the things around us, and even the friends we make. A other thing that can influence us is our family since DNA can give us some of our parents personally and the way they treat us can change our personally as well. Now other people who say we can chose have their own opinion as well. They think we can choose our own character traits. They say this because once you put your in mind on it you\\'ll be able keep it like that. I also thought this as well but that change because my family and friends were totally different they what I was going for and thats how I became what I did. They also think it would be worse to let pick on its own since it would be unhealthy.

They should be strictly managed instead of being free and are allowed to do whatever they want. For example, teenagers who hangout with their friends at night and get drunk are more likely to do something that is breaking the law when they are not sober enough. These young people tend to pull out their weapons to threat others who walk outside at night for money in order to buy illegal drugs. This is an important issue to pay attention on because these teenagers already become the worst humans being when they are not strictly managed by anyone or any law. However, they will keep threatenting others when the curfews aren't carried out to prevent them from doing their vicious things. In fact, there are several criminal cases that are committed by teenagers in America, which proves that the U.S. government is weak at controling their citizens and managing the society within the nation. This fact shows that the U.S. government does not care about the moral of young citizens and the safety of all citizens in general. The U.S. government should carry out curfews that keep all teenagers in control in order to limit any illegal acts.

For example, teenagers who turn out to be good people when they have parents who do not let them go out when the sky turns dark. Also, their parents strictly manage them and prevent them from going outside at night to do illegal things. However, some might believe that the curfews do a little improvement on teenagers because they still sneak out of their houses without their parents' awakeness to do what they like at night. This is an important issue to focus on because these teenagers will turn into adults who have several criminal records that might bother them from getting their jobs in the future. Moreover, teenagers should be more mature to realize that any violation acts that they had done will stay with them for the rest of their lives. Therefore, if the curfews is adopted then they should be obey to this law in order to avoid any unfortunate results that can occur in their lives. In fact, many companies prefer to choose employees with a good moral because they did not commit any crime in the past, which proves that they will not cause any danger while working in the companies. Unfortuantely, people who had done any crime or violated any law in the past will more likely to stay unemployed because they are considered to be dangerous.

Although school is important and necessary for success later on in life, so are outside experiences that can contribute to the development of a student's 'real life skills'. During summer break there are multiple activities that can be done in order to keep a student's mind active, whether it may be sports, summer camps, summer jobs etc. All these activities allow for their minds and bodies to stay active. Eventhough, they are not keeping their brains engaged in terms of school work and studying they are exposing themselves to new activities that might require them to think critically, open-mindedly and collaboratively; which I feel is essential for real life. For example, a student might be at summer camp and they are put in a group with four strangers and are given a challenging task that requires them to collaborate with the other member of the group, critically analyzing the situation and coming up with solutions and be open-minded to listening and trying to understand the perspectives of their peers. This also reflects their environment in school therefore, it can be said that they are keeping their minds active while outside of school.\",\n",

Due to all the demands in their life during the school year summer break is a good way to take a breather and take care of themselves mentally. Depression has been very common in teenagers in recent years, and although it may not be entirely due to the stress of school, school does contribute to the detirriation of their mental health. In addition, over-working ones self has negative impacts overall whether they are depressed or not. Too much stress in ones life can have negative effects on their health overall. High blood pressure, hypertension, severe weight loss are a few examples of the effects stress. Furthermore, when stressed our body releases a neurotransmitter called Cortisol, this neurotransmitter in excess can impair a persons thinking and reaction time; which is very important for students as they are required to think in order to complete school work and homework, therefore, if they dont take breaks their grades are probably going to drop due to their inability to think effectively, further contributing to their detirriating mental health.',\n",

My second reason on why having good aditude is important is that say that u didnt get the job, always stay cool and not try the flash out on anyone or even put it on anyone because you can always try again and theres always jobs that are hiring and available. There are many benifets of good aditude but few benefits are making friends, having a good life with no hate in your heart, get hired at jobs u apply at and many more. Benifets of having bad aditute can lead u to a place you wont like places like Jail if u talk back and not follow instructions or evan go to jail for not paying ur bills, get a office referal for not following directions and doing bad in school too. I've also witnessed bad aditude and good growing up. As in fifth grade I wasnt the best kid but I made bad decision and talk back at the teachers etc and that lead my mom taking away my ps4 so i cant play on it untill I fix what im doing. Also I remember when i was little, in church that if me and my siblings did good and behaved at church that my mom will buy us one candy each at a gas station of our choice so we followed that and had good aditude through out the whole church sessions continusly through out the times we attended church. Before my mother passed thats one of the many things she've taught me and my siblings to always have good aditude is because u can acomplish anything u worked hard at and respect people around you and a holy place like church.

Some people might say that a positive attitude is not the key to success in life because it can lead people to have some opportunities of good works and also to have friends, but they are wrong because having a good attitude all the time will help people to have greater opportunities at work as well at school.

One reason that this is important is because students need to know what they want to be and what they want to do when they grow up so when they go to school every day they know what they are working hard for. For example when they go to school they are going to be thinking about why they are in school for and how can they make their dream become true. another example is that they are going to be ready because they all ready know what they want because every day they went to school and they ask them self what do i want for my family? ,what do i want for my life ? why am i doing this for ?. they will not forget why they are in school for because they will have a goal for school. Another lesson I will tell them is that they need to do do their best in school because when they grow up they will need it on a everyday life. A reason why they have have to try their best in school is because when you grow up you will need it for everything you will need math,reading, writing and more .One example is that when you go to pay a bill you will need to know how much you need and how did it add up to all that amount of money and you will know how to because you went to school and you tried your best everyday you went. Another example is that everywhere you go you will need to read. This is why elementary school students need to know what they want to be when they grow up and why is important to go to school. And is important that they have good friends that will keep them going and to cheer them up because they might feel lonely and is not really good for them and everyone needs a friend that will help you when you need it and do let bad friends make you do bad things and you know what is good and what is bad .If you tell elementary school students what they have to do when they are small they will be better people in the world. Because some people dont take it for real but maybe they will be better and take it more serous. This is why is important this lesson for everyone.',\n",

Sometimes people can be irritable or just in a really bad mood because something is occurring in their lives, but in reality that's not how they really are. One reason first impressions can be wrong, is because maybe they didn't get enough sleep at night, and they have to get up early to go to work, or school in the morning. For example, i am not much of a morning person, so when i wake up in the mornings i can be rude, and people might not want to talk to me, but if you see me later in the afternoon i will be smiling, and laughing. Another reason first impressions could be wrong, is because they might not feel comfortable with the people who they are surrounded by, and be very shy, but once you start talking to them they change. For example, my best friend and i used to hate each other. I used to think she was annoying, and rude, and i am guessing she thought the same for me. One day we both started to talk to each other, and i found out we have many things in common, and that we are like the same people.

There are two things that are above all else, one is work hard, and the second one is work hard in silence but in a positive and a good way. positive attitude is the important thing in our daily life. It's not that we have to be 100% so we could get all we want, we all know not everyone in this world is perfect so we have to do things by what we really could do, the only thing that would help us in everything is positive attitude. Nowadays everyone think they could do everything without trying the best they could, and try it in a positive way, but i think they are wrong. If you want to get the same respect s everyone else you need to have a positive mind toward every different thing in this world. Whenever things keep goes wrong we need to ask our selves that are we doing what we suppose to do, are we being what our parents and our country taught us to be, so that way we could stop thing to go from right to wrong and stay positive in every way. before we start to do something new we need to ask someone that is experienced, so we will not get lost in the middle. Never give up on anything in this world things are not hard, we are the ones who makes them difficult to do. We are not pot in this world for keep quitting things to get to our goal, we are here alive to create change in world, to love people, to love the tradition, to keep doing positive and effective things for our generation and the upcoming generations. We are born to make people smile. We are not for hate, we are for love. We all should be trying to change the negative thought to a positive thought. When we have problem to solve, we need to think twice and think positive because that solution would defiantly impact others too. We should all try hard to be in a metier type place. In my opinion everyone should be thinking about how to be successful, how to be something better, how to make others feel better, and make them pot him/her as an idol. we all should always take responsibility for our action and consequences. If you want to be something memorable you have to be the change what others would like in you, and you are the one who could make it through hard and tough ways by a positive attitude. We are the ones who can change the world by just be different and make things easy and effective in a good and positive way. I know we do not want the world to go for hate and negative way instead of a positive and right way with full of benefits. If we want to work somewhere and we don't have control on our bad behavior and have negative attitude towards the boss and other workers we will not be successful, but if we do have control on our positive and negative attitude we will always be successful and always would get promotion in every place we are.
