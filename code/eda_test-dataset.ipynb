    "tkm = \"\"\"Being Southerners, it was a source of shame to some members of the family that  we had no recorded ancestors on either side of the Battle of Hastings. All we had  was Simon Finch, a fur-trapping apothecary from Cornwall whose piety was  exceeded only by his stinginess. In England, Simon was irritated by the  persecution of those who called themselves Methodists at the hands of their more  liberal brethren, and as Simon called himself a Methodist, he worked his way  across the Atlantic to Philadelphia, thence to Jamaica, thence to Mobile, and up  the Saint Stephens. Mindful of John Wesley’s strictures on the use of many words  in buying and selling, Simon made a pile practicing medicine, but in this pursuit  he was unhappy lest he be tempted into doing what he knew was not for the glory  of God, as the putting on of gold and costly apparel. So Simon, having forgotten  his teacher’s dictum on the possession of human chattels, bought three slaves and  with their aid established a homestead on the banks of the Alabama River some  forty miles above Saint Stephens. He returned to Saint Stephens only once, to find  a wife, and with her established a line that ran high to daughters. Simon lived to  an impressive age and died rich. \n",
    "It was customary for the men in the family to remain on Simon’s homestead,  Finch’s Landing, and make their living from cotton. The place was self-sufficient:  modest in comparison with the empires around it, the Landing nevertheless  produced everything required to sustain life except ice, wheat flour, and articles  of clothing, supplied by river-boats from Mobile. \n",
    "Simon would have regarded with impotent fury the disturbance between the North  and the South, as it left his descendants stripped of everything but their land, yet  the tradition of living on the land remained unbroken until well into the twentieth  century, when my father, Atticus Finch, went to Montgomery to read law, and his  younger brother went to Boston to study medicine. Their sister Alexandra was the  Finch who remained at the Landing: she married a taciturn man who spent most  of his time lying in a hammock by the river wondering if his trot-lines were full. When my father was admitted to the bar, he returned to Maycomb and began his  practice. Maycomb, some twenty miles east of Finch’s Landing, was the county \n",
    "seat of Maycomb County. Atticus’s office in the courthouse contained little more  than a hat rack, a spittoon, a checkerboard and an unsullied Code of Alabama. His  first two clients were the last two persons hanged in the Maycomb County jail.  Atticus had urged them to accept the state’s generosity in allowing them to plead  Guilty to second-degree murder and escape with their lives, but they were  Haverfords, in Maycomb County a name synonymous with jackass. The  Haverfords had dispatched Maycomb’s leading blacksmith in a misunderstanding  arising from the alleged wrongful detention of a mare, were imprudent enough to  do it in the presence of three witnesses, and insisted that the-son-of-a-bitch-had-it coming-to-him was a good enough defense for anybody. They persisted in  pleading Not Guilty to first-degree murder, so there was nothing much Atticus  could do for his clients except be present at their departure, an occasion that was  probably the beginning of my father’s profound distaste for the practice of  criminal law. \n",

    "va = \"\"\"To improve the compositionality of the semantic parser, VAPLs should be statically typed. They should include fine- grain domain-specific types and support definitions of cus- tom types. The ThinkTalk type system includes the standard types: strings, numbers, booleans, and enumerated types. It also has native support for common object types used in IoT devices and web services. Developers can also provide cus- tom entity types, which are internally represented as opaque identifiers but can be recalled by name in natural language. Arrays are the only compound type supported.\n",
    "To allow translation from natural language without con- textual information, the VAPL also needs a rich language for constants. For example, in ThingTalk, measures can be repre- sented with any legal unit, and can be composed additively (as in “6 feet 3 inches”, which is translated to 6ft + 3in); this is necessary because a neural semantic parser cannot perform arithmetic to normalize the unit during the translation.\n",
    "Arguments such as numbers, dates and times, in the input sentence are identified and normalized using a rule-based algorithm [15]; they are replaced as named constants of the form “NUMBER_0”, “DATE_1”, etc. String and named entity parameters instead are represented using multiple tokens, one for each word in the string or entity name; this allows the words to be copied from the input sentence individually. Named entities are normalized with a knowledge base lookup after parsing.\n",
    "The skill library defines the virtual assistant’s knowledge of the Internet services and IoTs. As such, the design of the representation as well as how information is organized are very important. In the following, we describe a high-level change we made to the original ThingTalk, then present the new syntax of classes and the design rationale.\n",
    "Orthogonality in Function Types. In the original Thing- pedia library, there are three kinds of functions: triggers, retrievals, and actions [8]. Triggers are callbacks or polling functions that return results upon the arrival of some event, retrievals return results, actions create side effects. Unfortu- nately, the semantics of callbacks and queries are not easily discernible by consumers. It is hard for users to understand that “when Trump tweets” and “get a Trump tweet” refer to two different functions. Furthermore, when a device sup- ports only a trigger and not a retrieval, or vice versa, it is not apparent to the user which is allowed. The inconsistency in functionality makes getting correct training and evaluation data problematic.\n",
    "In the new ThingTalk, we collapse the distinction between triggers and retrievals into one class: queries, which can be monitored as an event or used to get data. The runtime en- sures that any supported retrieval can be monitored as events, and vice versa. Not only does this provide more functionality, it also makes the language more regular and hence simpler for the users, crowdsourced paraphrase providers, and the neural model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Skill Definition Syntax. For modularity, every VAPL should include a skill library, a set of classes representing the domains and operations supported. In ThingTalk, skills are IoT devices or web services. The formal grammar of ThingTalk classes is shown in Fig. 3.\n",
    "Classes have functions, belonging to one of two kinds: query functions retrieve data and have no side-effects; action functions have side-effects but do not return data.\n",
